TAHLEQUAH, Okla.
 – On Jan. 14, Grand View School held its first Parent University to inform parents and students about college and vocational opportunities, as well as grants and scholarships. 
 --- The school’s federal grants director, Margaret Carlile, said the focus was to get students thinking about higher education. She said officials from the Cherokee Nation’s College Resource Center and Career Services spoke about scholarship opportunities and available programs.
 --- She said workers also helped parents and students apply for Oklahoma’s Promise Scholarship, which students must enroll for while in the eighth, ninth or 10th grade. The student’s family income must also not exceed $50,000 per year to be eligible for the scholarship.
 --- “It’s an amazing program. It’s not just for colleges. They can use it at vocational programs, also,” she said. 
 --- Carlile said a grant from the U.S. Education and Interior departments funds the Parent University. 
 --- “Tonight is our first Parent University for our National Youth Community Project Grant. We were one of 12 groups in the nation, and the only public school, stand-alone public school, who received one of these four-year grants,” she said. 
 --- According to a 2015 Cherokee Phoenix article, the school received approximately $341,000 for the first year with the possibility of being funded up to four years, depending on congressional approval. 
 --- Carlile said with the grant school officials want to get students interested in opportunities after they complete their high school. 
 --- “Our focus is college and career, so we’re going to be supporting students in examining careers, preparing themselves for college, and we’re doing leadership activities,” she said. “We’ve partnered with the Cherokee Nation Foundation and Northeastern (State University) and some other groups in the area to provide mentoring and (to) visit campuses.” 
 --- Carlile said she even hopes to take students to the Oklahoma State University-Institute of Technology in Okmulgee. 
 --- “I want the kids to not only think about college because you know the answer, ‘well, I want to be a doctor,’ but I want them to understand that there’s great jobs from a technical institute, also,” she said. 
 --- She said getting students on local campuses helps them feel familiar with the surroundings if they plan to attend one of the universities or institutions. 
 --- “I want them to learn that it’s not scary up there,” she said. “I want you to be able to go on that campus and say, ‘oh, I’ve been in there before.’” 
 --- Carlile said she and her colleagues try to make differences in their students’ lives. 
 --- “Sometimes you don’t know for a long time that you made a difference, but sometimes they come back and check in and say ‘I’m in school. I wanted to let you know that it made a difference,’” she said. 
 --- Carlile said school officials plan to continue the Parent University as a monthly event. 
 --- “The emphasis will be different, but tentatively we’re planning a resource fair of some sort in February. March will be a literacy event, and in April we’re going to have a family STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) night. We’ll have hands-on science activities that the children and their families will do and, we’ll just kind of be there to facilitate it,” she said. 
 --- Tahlequah resident Melissa Wofford said she attended the first Parent University to learn more about it. Her son, Caleb, attends the school and is in the fourth grade. 
 --- “I was kind of hoping to see what it was about and see what was going on up here at the school and see what opportunities they had because I heard they had gotten a grant, but I didn’t really know what it was about,” she said. 
 --- Wofford said she’s glad to see Grand View offering such opportunities. 
 --- “Grand View’s an awesome school, and they give a lot of really cool opportunities,” she said. “We’ve really, really enjoyed having our kids here.” 
 --- Carlile said in the future school officials hope to get more families coming to Parent University events. 
 --- “This is just our first step. We’re going to get better at it. Most people don’t know what we’re doing yet. It’s taken a little while to disseminate the information and the opportunities,” she said. “We have high expectations and high hopes for what we’ll be able to accomplish.” 
 --- Carlile said if anyone is interested in talking to students about careers or giving students tours of their workplaces to call at 918-456-5131.

PARK HILL, Okla. 
– After more than a decade, the Cherokee Heritage Center has a new curator. One who is familiar with the center after having worked at it before. 
--- Callie Chunestudy, 34, took over the position on Nov. 9 after former CHC Curator Mickel Yantz accepted a job with the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa. 
--- Chunestudy is a graduate of Northeastern State University with a bachelor’s degree in fine arts. 
--- “The Heritage Center has always held a big place in my heart. It’s where I worked at 16 on (Cherokee Nation) Summer Youth (Employment Program) and at 18 for the pottery division back when that was going on,” she said. 
--- Through the Summer Youth Employment Program, Chunestudy said she gave tours in Adam’s Corner, the CHC’s rural village that depicts Cherokee life in the 1890s before Oklahoma statehood. Chunestudy added that she also worked in the museum archives department and as a secretary under the same employment program, giving her a total of two years experience at CHC before her current position. --- As for her curator job, she said in many ways she wants to follow her predecessor’s path. --- “Mickel was here 11 years, so I have big shoes to fill. He left a legacy of great shows and exhibits that he put together for the Heritage Center,” she said. “My hope is to continue that legacy while bringing new eyes and new things to the table. We have some really great shows coming up, including our current exhibit, ‘Talking Leaves to Pixels: The History of the Cherokee Syllabary,’ which runs from Jan. 15 until April 2.” Chunestudy said she is also looking forward to the 2016 Trail of Tears Art Show, which follows the syllabary exhibit. 
--- “It will be the first time I’m completely in charge of an art show and competition, so I’m very excited about that,” she said. “And for the first time, we’re going to partner with Cherokee Art Market and also hold their youth art show and competition. So it will run concurrent, here at the Heritage Center, and the winners’ art will be up for the duration of the Trail of Tears Art Show.” 
--- As for why she wanted the curator job, Chunestudy said she’s always been interested in helping preserve and showcase Cherokee culture. 
--- “Art is a great way to do that because everyone can find common ground in beauty. Working at the Cherokee Heritage Center and being a good steward of our collections while helping promote the Cherokee artists that are living today is a very important goal for me,” she said. 
--- CHC Executive Director Candessa Tehee said the CHC is fortunate to have Chunestudy join the staff again. 
--- “She has a background in fine arts yet brings a deep understanding of Cherokee culture and communities with her to the position,” Tehee said. “Her enthusiasm for Cherokee art traditions is evident in her approach to her work and she has a bright future with the CHC.” 
--- The CHC is located at 21192 S. Keeler Drive. It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday from Sept. 16 until June 14 and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday from June 15 to Sept. 15.

STILWELL, Okla.
 – Since she began making it for her family as a young girl, 1992 Cherokee National Treasure Edith Knight has become an expert at making kanuchi, which is a traditional Cherokee meal made from hickory nuts.
  --- Knight received her National Treasure honor for making tear dresses. As for being an expert kanuchi maker, she said, “After I make it I never have any left.”
   --- Knight also said there are good and bad years for hickory nuts. This year, the hickory trees surrounding her home did not produce at all. So she had to gather nuts from a friend whom she knew had Mockernut hickory trees.
    --- “My mother made it for many years, and I learned to make it just like she did,” Knight said at her Adair County home. “You see there’s different kinds of hickory nuts. I like to use the Mockernut hickory because it has a larger nut-meat and it has a better flavor.”
     --- According to www.cherokee.org, hickory nuts are gathered in the fall and allowed to dry for a few weeks before the kanuchi making begins.
      --- “Begin by cracking, then shelling the hickory nuts by shaking the pieces through a loosely woven basket, or picking them out by hand,” the website states. “Traditionally, a section of log or a tree stump was hollowed out into a bowl-like shape. The shelled hickory nuts are placed in the hollowed log bowl and pounded with a long heavy stick until they are of a consistency that can be formed into a ball that will hold its shape. Kanuchi balls are usually about 3 inches in diameter and must be stored in a cold place. Today kanuchi is usually preserved by freezing.”
       --- In today’s world, kanuchi is considered a delicacy although it is believed to have been used as a filler when food was scarce.
        --- “I believe sometimes in the long past kanuchi might have been all they had to eat. It was one of the few foods they could store because of it coming from the hull,” Knight said.
         --- Knight said kanuchi is sometimes made with corn or hominy and seasoned with salt, although her family has always preferred to mix the hickory solution with rice and add sugar. 
         --- She said today most people don’t use the traditional “kanon” or hollowed out log to contain the crushed nuts. “The idea is to keep hammering until the nut meat rises to the top and the oils begin to make it stick together. That’s how you make a kanuchi bowl.” 
         --- During the kanuchi-making process, Knight said she advises to start cooking the rice early and to always sift and boil the slurry twice before proceeding. She said that gets rid of all the bacteria.
          --- “Remember we pick these (hickory nuts) up off the ground.”
          --- After tasting the finished product, Owen said, “It’s good. I think you did real good.”

– The Cherokee Nation’s Education Services hosted a College and Career Night on Dec. 3 in which more than 200 students spoke with representatives from several colleges while also learning about services available and scholarship opportunities the tribe offers. 
--- “It was the first Education Services event to try to bring in all of our scholarship recipients to get a better working relationship with all of the institutions and also bringing in students who are interested in going to school,” Dr. Neil Morton, Education Services advisor, said. 
--- Several presentations were also given regarding opportunities available such as the Gates Millennium Scholarship, how to apply for Free Application for Federal Student Aid, Cherokee Nation Foundation scholarships and services, Indian Capital Technology Center programs, CN Career Services and CN College Housing programs. 
--- Morton said the event was to provide students with more of an awareness of available sources and to emphasize that they shouldn’t depend on only one source. 
--- For CN citizen and Oolagah High School senior Madyson Driver having more than one source and seeing what scholarships are available is what prompted her to attend. 
--- “To also get different advice on what to do and what applications to fill out,” she said. 
--- Driver said she plans to attend Northeastern Stat University to study speech pathology to become a pediatric speech therapist. She said she decided on that career while participating in the tribe’s Career Services summer day work program at the Summit Physical Therapy offices in Claremore. 
--- Representatives from NSU, University of Arkansas, University of Oklahoma, Rogers State University, University of Central Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University, Connors State College, Bacone College and Carl Albert State College were also in attendance for students to speak with. 
--- Jay Falkner, Carl Albert State College associate vice president of enrollment management, said one reason his college attended the event was because of the great partnership that has developed over a long time working with Cherokee students. 
--- Carl Albert State College’s main campus is in Poteau, but has a Sallisaw branch, too. 
--- “A lot of our Cherokee students attend the Sallisaw campus, so we’re really excited about upcoming opportunities to work with the Cherokee Nation,” Falkner said. 
--- Falkner said events such as the college fair help students because now students focus more on how they’re going to finance their education and what employment opportunities will be available after college. 
--- “So it’s not so much about student life anymore as it is about opportunities in career advancement when they’re done, so a lot of the questions now that we deal with are related to financing your education and career options,” he said. 
--- For more information on what scholarships and opportunities are available, call the College Resource Center at 918-453-5465 or email ---  collegeresources@cherokee.org .

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. 
– On Nov. 24, the Cherokee Nation kicked off the season of giving with its 2015 Angel Project event to help provide Christmas gifts to Cherokee children in need. --- To begin the giving, CPR, a Tribal Employment Rights Office-certified and Cherokee-owned roofing business, donated 250 bicycles to the help fill the wants of children who were a part of the Angel Project. --- “Giving back is something my mother raised me to do and my employees love helping give back also,” CPR President Robert Brown said. “I remember one year when my mother was unable to buy me a Christmas gift and she received help from a local store owner, who helped her in providing me that one toy under the Christmas tree.” --- Rachel Fore, CN Indian Child Welfare administrative operations manager, said the donation of bikes would cover a “large amount” of what children are requesting for their respective Christmas gifts. --- “That’s a fabulous donation that we haven’t ever had before, so it kind of changed the way we had to do things on the application side,” she said. “We pretty swiftly decided that we would just pull all the angels that have requested bikes and then we would utilize the funds that we receive to fill in the needs for those children.” --- Fore said she became emotional when she saw all 250 bike on various trailers parked outside the W.W. Keeler Tribal Complex. --- “I teared up because as you take application after application there are so many needs out there and very little wants really from our Cherokee children that are on the Angel Project, and so to see that someone would identify a very, very big want that a lot of kids wouldn’t even dream to ask for, that’s really impactful, and it’s a great way that Cherokees are helping Cherokees,” she said. --- Fore said there were nearly 2,000 children who are a part of the project. She added that she expects to see around 100 emergency applicants in the coming weeks. --- “As we get closer people will say, ‘I didn’t know that I was going to have this expense’ or ‘my husband lost his job last week.’ So we will take in those children and provide for them as well,” she said. “Last year, we provided for 2,016 children so we are going to maintain open and available to operate up to that this year.” --- Fore said in some cases not all children on the tree are picked, but she said with the help of donated funds they will not go without. --- “Typically, it is the case that we have to shop for anywhere from 200 to 400 that aren’t selected off of a tree,” she said. “We utilize our donated funds to do that. We focus on their needs first then at least get them one want for the year.” --- Fore said this is her first year to fully be immersed in the CN Angel Project, and that is has been a “humbling” experience. --- “You think, ‘what is it going to be like to take these applications?’ and then you look into the eyes of these mothers and fathers that just want to be able to provide for their kids at Christmas,” she said. “I didn’t probably realize that it would impact me so much.” --- She said is also impacts her family and how they partake in Christmas. --- “It also impacts me in my own personal life because I look at my kids and think I probably over buy for Christmas most years for my own children,” she said. “So, given a little perspective through the Angel Project we’re looking at that differently in our own family this year. What we can maybe pare back on and provide to those that wouldn’t receive half of what I might buy for my own kids.” --- The Angel Project is available to CN citizens living within the tribe’s 14-county jurisdiction, meet income guidelines and have children who are between 0 to 16 years old. --- Fore said all donations need to be returned unwrapped to Cherokee First inside the Tribal Complex by Dec. 9. “You can come adopt an angel right up until then,” she said. --- According to a CN press release, tax-free monetary donations to help buy gifts can be made to the CN at ---  http://bit.ly/1OxObLR .

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The U.S. Education and Interior departments recently awarded more than $900,000 in grants between Grand View School and the American Indian Resource Center to help Native youths become college and career ready. --- Grand View School was awarded approximately $341,000 for the first year of funding with the possibility of being funded up to four years, depending on congressional approval. --- “One of the things we want to do is provide mentoring and shadowing opportunities so they can see other successful people from this area,” Margaret Carlile, Grand View School federal grants director, said. --- Superintendent Ed Kennedy said the grant would get Native American youths in schools or in other organizations better prepared for college or career fields as they move through the process. --- “We worked with our grant writer and we took the approach that we were going to try to work and get parents educated early on about the opportunities for their kids, and get them talking to their kids at an early age for this,” he said. “We want them successful wherever they go so that they can take that next step once they leave high school.” --- Pamela Iron, AIRC public relations liaison, said the AIRC’s grant of $584,000 for the next four years would benefit Cherokee County students in grades 5-8. --- “AIRC is partnering with the Cherokee Nation Foundation, the Cherokee Immersion (Charter) School and the Cherokee Nation educational department to provide a holistic approach for career and college readiness that includes financial literacy, ACT prep, after-school tutoring, career readiness and leadership development,” Iron said. “Approximately 1,700 youth, in 12 rural schools, will benefit from the Four Directions Grant. Project Venture, an evidenced-based experiential adventure curriculum aimed at developing personal skills such as internal locus of control, decision make/problem solving and judgment, will be used for the leadership development component.” --- Iron also said a new computer lab at the Cherokee Immersion Charter School would be part of the after-school tutoring program. --- Other activities include college campus tours and science, technology, engineering and math-related activities in the 12 targeted schools and summer camps, she said. --- The awards were a part of a $5.3 million grant funding for the new Native Youth Community Projects program. According to a release, the Department of Education is making grants to a dozen recipients in nine states that would impact more than 30 tribes and involve more than 48 schools. --- “These grants are an unprecedented investment in Native youth, and a recognition that tribal communities are best positioned to drive solutions and lead change,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. “These grants are a down payment on President Obama’s commitment last summer at his historic trip to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota to create new opportunities for American Indian youth to cultivate the next generation of Native leaders.” --- U.S. Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell said the grant funding is part of the Obama administration’s commitment to self-determination. --- “By putting tribal communities in the driver’s seat for developing a strong and prosperous future for Indian Country,” Jewell said. “These grants provide tools to tribes to not only assist in the transition from federal to tribal control of school operations and management but also ensure college-readiness for the next generation of Native American leaders.” --- For more information, visit ---  www.whitehouse.gov/nativeamericans .

VINITA, Okla. – Until recently, the Schrimsher Cemetery, about 6 miles northwest of Vinita, was forgotten and overgrown with trees and grass. Today it has a new fence surrounding and protecting it from cattle, and the trees and tall grass have been cut away. --- On Nov. 14, the descendants of Arminda and Irene England, who are buried in the cemetery, gathered there with Oklahoma Trail of Tears Association members to honor the two Cherokee women. As children they traveled the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory with the Richard Taylor detachment. --- The detachment left near Ross’s Landing on the Tennessee River on Sept. 20, 1838, with 1,029 people and arrived near what is now Westville on March 24, 1839. It had 55 deaths and 15 births during the journey. --- Arminda England descendant Wesley Harris, of Heber Springs, Arkansas, said he saw a Cherokee Phoenix article several years ago about a grave marking by the Oklahoma TOTA and inquired about getting his great-great-grandmother’s grave marked. --- He said he’s worked with Oklahoma TOTA President Curtis Rohr to get the grave marked. He sent Rohr his genealogy to show how he was related to Arminda, and the association’s genealogist, David Hampton, researched Harris’ genealogy to verify the connection. --- “Arminda was 7 years old during the Trail of Tears, and they (her family) settled on Honey Creek near Grove,” Harris said. “It’s very humbling to realize what they had to go through – as a 7-year-old girl in the winter time having to go that far. It they hadn’t done it we wouldn’t be here today, and it’s part of my history, and I’m very proud of it. I’ve always been proud of it ever since I was a little fella and my parents would tell us stories about it.” --- He said the event allowed the two sisters’ descendants to meet at a luncheon before the ceremony. Harris said he met his cousin Carol Wright, of Tulsa, for the first time that day. --- Wright is the great-great-great-granddaughter of Irene England, who traveled the Trail of Tears at age 10. --- Wright said she felt “honored” to be a part of the ceremony to honor her grandmother. Wright credits her husband Phil for providing her with her genealogy and letting her know of her relations. --- “I find it very interesting to find that these people are important enough to be remembered for what they’ve done because when we went to Schrimsher Cemetery it was this (waist) high in grass. So, it’s nice to know this has made a difference and the cemetery’s being taken care of now,” she said. --- Harris said the owner of the land where the cemetery sits, and his family, removed fallen trees and saplings and mowed the grass. A wrought iron fence was also placed around the cemetery to keep out cattle. --- Troy Wayne Poteete, executive director of the National Trail of Tears Association and CN Supreme Court chief justice, said every time the TOTA marks the grave of a Trial of Tears survivor it’s an opportunity for it to tell the larger Cherokee story, which includes the story of the two sisters. --- “It’s a story of survival, of resilience, of tenacity. That’s what we celebrate. We celebrate that they overcame, that they rebuilt the Cherokee Nation and they handed it off to the next generation – a distinct political entity, a distinct cultural entity, a Cherokee Nation that could hold its own and retain its identity,” Poteete said. “That’s why we do this. That why we are here today, to commemorate their tenacity, their resilience, their sheer will to carry on as a people.” --- Irene was born in 1828 in the old CN, probably on the Tusquittee Creek in what is now Clay County, North Carolina, where her family ran a mill. Her father was a white man named David England and her mother was a half-blood Cherokee named Susannah Fields. Arminda was born three years later on Nov. 25, 1831. --- During the forced removal, David England supplied a horse team for the detachment. Following the Trail of Tears, the family settled on Honey Creek. Later the family moved to the Big Cabin Creek area north of what is now Vinita. --- In 1847, Arminda married William England, son of Susannah Ward and William England, and they had one daughter, Mary Jane. After their separation, Arminda married Isaac Schrimsher and they were the parents of four daughters: Alta Berilla Meek, Arabella Southerland, Saphronia Susan Mayne Rogers Nolen and Ruth Ann Tyler. After the start of the Civil War, Cherokees supporting the Union killed Isaac. --- “A group of Cherokees who were sympathetic to the north came down and killed her husband and his slave, beat her with his scalp for marrying a white man, took all the cattle and horses, and left her there with the bodies of her dead husband and slave. She had to walk 20 miles to where her father lived, and he came back and buried the husband and the slave,” Harris said. “After that she married Elias Jenkins (in 1867), who is my line and where I’m from.” --- The Jenkins farmed on Big Cabin Creek and had two children: Ida Josephine Harris and Henry Washington Jenkins. Arminda Jenkins died, probably at her home near Vinita, on Dec. 27, 1879, and was buried in the Schrimsher Cemetery. --- About 1853, Irene married Edward Lee Schrimsher. After the Civil War the family farmed north of present-day Vinita in the Cooweescoowee District. Irene and Edward were the parents of four children who lived to adulthood: William Schrimsher, Eliza Ann Williamson, Laura Kelly and Margaret Ann Tanner. In addition they had five children who died in childhood. Irene died probably at her home north of Vinita, on Oct. 9, 1882, and was buried in the Schrimsher Cemetery. --- Bronze TOTA plaques were placed on the women’s graves that read: “In honor of one who endured the forced removal of the Cherokees in 1838-39. The Trail of Tears Association Oklahoma Chapter.” The plaques also include the TOTA and CN seals. --- “It was such an honor to have the Cherokee Nation and the Trail Of Tears Association recognize two ordinary citizens who endured the forced march. My relatives and I feel this project is important because it keeps alive in people’s minds our history and how so many suffered,” Harris said.

PRYOR, Okla. – In a joint effort to bring jobs to people who are looking for employment, Cherokee Nation Career Services, MidAmerica Industrial Park and Pryor Workforce Center hosted a job fair on Oct. 28 at the MidAmerica Expo Center. --- “Whenever we partner up with different organizations like the Pryor Workforce Center and the MidAmerica Industrial Park we know that we’re combining all of our resources, all of our connections with the different businesses and bringing them all together, which is going to help employees get jobs,” Hunter Palmer, CN Career Services job fair coordinator, said. --- More than 200 people attended the fair to see what jobs the 20 vendors that attended had available. --- “We want to increase the odds of people getting jobs, so if we have more businesses it’s going to increase the chance of someone getting a job,” Palmer said. “Our mission for the Career Services department is to help people get jobs, and any time we have the opportunity to have job fairs (it) is going to maximize the probability of them getting jobs. Whenever you go visit employers you never know who is hiring and who is not hiring, but whenever you go to a job fair, you know they’re there because they have positions available.” --- Palmer said Career Services tries to host more than two job fairs a month and have hosted nearly 20 this year. --- Some vendors included Arby’s, Macy’s, Cherokee Nation Entertainment, RAE Corp., Home for Hope, Northeast Technology Center, Talking Leaves Job Corps, Red Devil, Oklahoma State University Institute of Technology, Cherokee Career Connections and G4S. --- “There are a variety of businesses here anywhere from manufacturing, health care and food service,” Tonya Backward, Industrial Park workforce development coordinator, said. “Just about anything you could possibly think of anywhere from entry-level positions all the way up to upper management.” --- Backward said one benefit for the applicants is that they have an opportunity to speak personally to somebody who may have hiring authority. --- CN citizen Katie Snell, of Salina, said the fair was a good way for her to see what jobs were available in the area. --- “It was pretty detailed,” she said. “Everyone explained things pretty well about their companies. I think it offers a lot of opportunities to see what’s available around your area.”

WARNER, Okla. – Two Cherokee men are building on the success they had in 2014 with their “Birds of the Cherokee Nation” calendar and are offering a 2016 version. --- The calendar consists of photographs of area birds and their Cherokee names in the tribe’s syllabary. Jeff Davis, of Warner, and David Cornsilk, of Tahlequah, collaborated on the calendar. Cornsilk researched the Cherokee names for the birds and Davis provided the photographs. --- “Last year’s calendar was very well received. This year’s calendar features 14 different birds. I’ve had numerous people thank me for publishing it and said they were looking forward to this 2016 edition,” Davis said. --- Because he descends from the Cherokee Bird Clan, Davis said, as a photographer, birds are some of his favorite subjects. Davis, who is also an artist and descendant of Principal Chief John Ross, said a reason for doing the calendar in 2014 was to help promote the language. --- When living in Kenwood in Delaware County, Cornsilk said he listened to Cherokee speakers talk about birds and the meaning of their names. He said he noticed the older speakers knew a lot of birds’ names but younger speakers knew hardly any. --- Out of concern for the Cherokee language, Cornsilk began collecting bird names in Cherokee for a book he thought he would write. He then decided to collaborate with Davis, who already had local bird photos, to make the calendar. --- Davis said many Cherokee speakers just use the word jee-squa, which means bird, for every bird. He said he hopes the calendar helps people learn how the Cherokee names of different birds living in northeastern Oklahoma. --- Each bird in the calendar has a Cherokee syllabary and English phonetic name, as well as an explanation of what the bird means to the Cherokee. --- On the calendar’s back cover is a copy of the Cherokee syllabary to help translate the bird names and the months in Cherokee listed with the photos. Also included in the calendar is a list of moons associated with each month and what Cherokee beliefs are associated with each moon. Cherokee translator William Eubanks compiled those beliefs in the 1890s, and Cherokee linguist Lawrence Panther translated the calendar’s name. --- The calendars are available for $10 at the Cherokee Nation Gift Shop, Cherokee Heritage Center Gift Shop, and the Spider Gallery in Tahlequah. By mail order, the price is $12.95 each, which includes shipping. PayPal or postal money orders are accepted. For PayPal send payment to ---  entimeart@gmail.com , and to mail payment, send to: J. Davis, P.O. Box 492, Warner OK 74469.

CATOOSA, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation’s Health Services is bringing in some outside assistance to lower – and potentially eliminate – the local hepatitis C rate. --- Earlier this year, Health Services received a one-year, $1.5 million grant to fund a study on identifying and treating hepatitis C patients among northeastern Oklahoma’s Native American community. --- Part of a partnership with the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oklahoma Department of Health, the study will focus on surveillance and epidemiology. --- According to the World Health Organization, hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus. The virus can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis infection, ranging in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. The virus is a blood-borne virus and the most common modes of infection are through unsafe injection practices, inadequate sterilization of medical equipment and the transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products. --- With positive results popping up across the tribe’s jurisdictional area, part of the funding will also go to increased staffing among the tribe’s health facilities to better address screening and treating the disease. --- “The Cherokee Nation’s project is first project of its kind in the country to take on hepatitis C,” Dr. John Ward, the CDC’s director of viral hepatitis, said on Oct. 30 at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa. Ward was the keynote speaker at a conference to discuss the tribe’s study. “It will obviously help people here, but will also help people elsewhere by providing a template to show how it’s done.” --- Nationwide, there are an estimated 2.7 million people with the disease, which if left untreated, can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or liver failure. Because the disease produces mild symptoms, if any, in the early stages, it is often not detected until liver damage becomes apparent. --- With the virus able to survive on surfaces for up to three weeks, exposure to contaminated needles, either through intravenous drug use, medical procedures or piercings, is among the primary risk factors for the disease. --- “Hepatitis C isn’t the problem,” Dr. Jorge Mera, director of infectious diseases for CN Health Services, said. “It’s the symptom of a bigger problem: intravenous drug use.” --- Other risk factors included extended reliance on dialysis machines for blood filtration, receiving a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992, having unprotected sex with multiple partners, being born to a mother with the virus or being HIV-positive. --- As part of the grant, Mera and other clinicians will examine what causal role, if any, tattooing, the second most common risk factor nationwide, plays in contracting the disease. --- Since January 2014, CN clinics have treated 274 cases of hepatitis C with the lowest rates. About 60 percent of the patients are part of the Baby Boomer generation, those born 1946-65, compared to 75 percent of all hepatitis C patients nationwide. --- Mera said his department estimates there are between 4,000 and 5,000 cases across the 14 counties, but have only screened less than a quarter of potential cases so far. --- With a goal of testing 85 percent of the adult population, the grant also covers additional screening for CN citizens as young as 20 years old who think they might have the disease. ---  “We want to encourage people to come in and get tested,” Mera said. “If you belong to the Baby Boomer category, you definitely need to come in and get checked. That doesn’t mean that if you’re 72 and want to get screened that we won’t do it. Just come in, ask, and we will.” --- According to a CN press release, with the funding and support of fellow health agencies, nearly 300 patients at the tribe’s W.W. Hastings Hospital identified with hepatitis C have been treated with shots, doctors said for 90 percent it was effective for curing the illness. --- “We have close to 1,000 patients who have tested positive for the disease, and we have already treated nearly a quarter of those and are seeing a high success rate. Our hope is to eliminate this disease entirely in the Cherokee Nation,” Mera said. --- Others attending were CDC’s director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS Jonathan Mermin, Oklahoma Department of Health Deputy Secretary Julie Cox-Kain, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Infectious Diseases Professor Douglas Drevets and OU Health Sciences Center Dean Gary Raskob.

BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. – A young Cherokee Nation citizen is making a name for herself in the BMX world, also known as bicycle motocross. Payton Sarabia, 5, has two big titles under her belt and is just beginning her biking journey. --- Payton’s mother, Priscilla, said Payton became interested in BMX after attending one session. --- “It was very hard to find a sport that would take kids at that young of an age, and BMX was one of them. We took her one day and she tried (it) and from there she was hooked,” she said. “She started on one of those little bikes that don’t have pedals, it kind of teaches the kid to balance. From there she moved onto pedal bikes, which is what she’s on now and competing on.” --- Payton said she likes the sport because she likes making friends and “jumping” her bike. --- Priscilla said Payton’s usual class she races with, the 5 and under class, is extremely competitive. --- “For 5 years old you would just expect girls going out there and having fun, but they are very, very competitive,” she said. “Something you would expect for boys, but it actually comes out in the girls.” --- Priscilla said this year Payton took won the Arizona championship and third place for the DK Bikes Gold Cup Regional Championship, both in the 5 and under girls class. --- “This year is the first year we’ve actually competed for state and the gold cup,” she said. “The state races, there were several throughout the state. She participated in, I want to say, six of them. Out of the state races they take the highest four scores and then they compete in the final, and whoever has the most points and the most wins at the end is the one who goes home with the state championship.” --- Priscilla said Payton gets to carry the first-place plate on her bike for winning state. She also received a 2015 state championship backpack. --- She said Payton competed against girls in the western region of the United States to win the third place title for the DK Bikes Gold Cup. --- “That’s just kids her age and her proficiency to what area,” she said. “They kind of race it out to see who goes home with the win.” --- Priscilla said she is proud of her daughter and her accomplishments with the sport. --- “I was very excited. I was proud. In the end she made part of history,” she said. “It’s very rare to even know somebody who wins one of those because there’s so many kids competing.” --- The Tuff Gurlz Trophy Team, an all-girl BMX team, sponsors Payton. --- Priscilla said Payton is known for wearing her purple tutu over her racing gear. --- “When she first started BMX she couldn’t decide between BMX or dance so that was kind of how she got her name, ‘Payton the Purple Pickle Flying Tutu’ is because she wore a tutu over her riding gear,” she said. “She still holds that name and still wears her purple tutu.” --- Payton said she likes wearing her purple tutu because it makes her “fast” so that she can win. --- Priscilla said when parents see Payton wear her tutu they try to get their daughters involved with the sport. --- “A lot of the races that we go to, some parents have their boys that race and they try to get their daughters into the sport, but you know a girl’s normal reaction is, ‘that’s for boys. No, I don’t want to do that.’ So they always come up to Payton and ask to take a picture of her in a tutu so they can go home and show their daughters that girls do the sport and you can do it,” she said. “She actually motivates quite a bit of people in the sport.”

PARADISE HILL, Okla. – Peek-A-Boo Petting Zoo in Sequoyah County celebrated its third anniversary earlier this year. It’s owned by Will and Jill Gates, a Cherokee Nation citizen, and offers 25 animal exhibits with 18 different species and more than 100 animals to see, pet and feed. --- The zoo is located about 25 miles south of Tahlequah in Sequoyah County near Gore and has been open since Easter 2012. Some of the animals for petting are baby chicks, geese, hedgehogs and rabbits. Peek-A-Boo also offer larger animals such as pigs, turkeys, donkeys and llamas. --- “Things that are gentle for kids to get in the pin with, hold, pet and feed,” Jill said. --- Since opening, Jill, her husband and family have added more animals, space and activities for children and their families. --- In October, the zoo offered a pumpkin patch where children can play and choose a pumpkin after seeing the animals. Also available to patrons are the picnic tables and pavilion. --- “We have a party pavilion/picnic shelter that visitors like to use for birthday parties or family reunions. It makes it a lot easier when having guests rather than at their own home,” she said. “People can come just for picnics if they like. They don’t have to schedule for a birthday.” --- The normal business season for Peek-A-Boo Petting Zoo is around Easter to the first week or two in November, depending on weather. Hours are from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. and are closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. --- “During the month of October we’re open every day from noon to 6:30 p.m. during the week and from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekends,” she said. “Our season will end about the first week or two in November depending upon the weather. With kids back in school things really slow down so we’ll be open mainly on nicer weekends.” --- For new visitors, Jill said her business has a great reputation and that is what has helped to keep her in business over these past few years. --- “People enjoy the outdoors. They enjoy the hands-on experience with the animals. Owners do everything they can to be out there with the customers,” she said. “The first summer was a little slow going, but people have really, really increased.” --- She added that Facebook and word-of-mouth have helped their business. --- “Business is just continually growing. We’re happy to have it growing, but we want to keep it somewhat small so we can still be personable. We know a lot of our visitors by name and want to keep it that way,” she said. --- Admission prices are $5 per person, which includes feed for animals. Children 2 and under are free as well as those with a military ID. For more information, visit the zoo’s Facebook at ---  https://www.facebook.com/Peekaboo-Petting-Zoo-223954384342313/ or call 918-816-6506.

PARK HILL, Okla. – Cherokee artist Danny McCarter, of Tahlequah, possesses skills handed down by Cherokee people for hundreds of years. He makes blowguns from river cane and the darts shot from it. --- Along with knowing these skills, he uses a blowgun at his job as a villager in the Cherokee Heritage Center’s Diligwa Village. He interprets for the village’s visitors the Cherokee lifeways of the mid-1700s. --- To make darts, he uses a thistle plant and a wooden shaft, which is usually difficult for a person when first trying. --- “I can teach people to make a blowgun in one day...but the dart is really the art part because it takes a lot of dexterity to roll the dart and catch the thistle on there,” he said. “It looks simple when you see somebody do it that’s done it a thousand times, but it’s really difficult.” --- His late uncle, J.C. McCarter, who worked in the CHC’s Ancient Village, introduced him to the blowgun. Danny’s brother, Rob, and another villager named Scott Rackliff also had a hand in teaching Danny about the blowgun and dart making when they worked in the village in the 1980s. --- Danny said from what he’s studied it is not known where the river cane blowgun originated or who invented it, but it has always been used for hunting. Some cultures in South America used it in warfare because they could deliver tranquilizers with darts. However, he said, Cherokee people used the blowgun to hunt squirrels, rabbits and birds and relied on accuracy to kill those animals. Cherokee youths also used it to keep animals out of gardens. --- He said Cherokees were people small in stature, so most tools they used didn’t require great strength but technique instead. He said some people try to use a large puff of air to blow a dart from a blowgun when all that’s required is a “quick, hard” burst of breath. --- He said he’s won the Cherokee National Holiday blowgun contest with just a 4-1/2-foot long blowgun when competitors used longer blowguns to shoot at a target 45 feet away. He conceded that darts coming out his shorter blowgun are somewhat thicker or heavier so they can travel that distance. --- Danny begins gathering the Scottish Thistle that he uses to fletch his darts after it blooms about mid-August in northeastern Oklahoma. Its purple blooms will first appear in the northern part of the Cherokee Nation and later in the southern part. He said thistle in Sequoyah County might not bloom until mid-September. --- “You don’t want to pick it while it’s purple. You want to pick it while it’s brown. If you gather it while it’s purple and try to put it up (save it for later), it will mold,” he said. --- He said for accuracy and distance, thistle is the best material for fletching. He said most Oklahoma Cherokees only use their blowguns to compete in contests in which a circular target is 45 feet away and that most blowguns are 8- to 10-feet-long. As with a rifle, the longer the blowgun the farther a dart can travel and maintain its velocity. --- For fletching, he takes a dried thistle bulb and removes the brown, seedy part from the pod, avoiding pulling out the bulb’s white, fluffy downy that will form the fletching. --- “That’s all you want, just the downy part on the inside,” he said. --- He then finds a straight, wooden skewer and notches it on top. He said a person could carve the dart out of woods such as river cane and bois d’arc, which he said both make pretty and sturdy darts. Other woods used for dart shafts are oak, ash, maple, hickory and walnut. However, to save time, he purchases a 100-pack of wooden skewers, usually used to skewer food, for his dart shafts. --- After notching the top of a skewer, he takes quilting thread and knots on one end and places in the notch. He then places the downy part of the thistle pod against the stick and wraps the thread around the downy to attach it to the stick. It takes an intricate use of his hands and his teeth to attach the thistle downy to the stick with the thread. --- He ties the end of the thread where the downy ends on the stick and then rolls the stick in his hands to get rid of any remaining seeds or loose downy. --- “We’ve used all kinds of materials for that fletching. We’ve used the downy feathers of birds, squirrel tail, and rabbit fur. The Choctaws of Mississippi use raw cotton because that’s what they have in their area, but really thistle is the greatest material,” he said. “It’s keeps your dart in the middle of your gun. It also gives you something to blow against, and it also gives you a guide like feathers on an arrow.”

LOST CITY, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Larry Shade has lived his life in this northern Cherokee County community learning the ways of the Cherokee culture from his grandparents and father, the late Deputy Chief Hastings Shade. Among the cultural aspects he’s learned, one he truly enjoys is crawdad gigging. --- Larry gigs crawdads in a section of Fourteen Mile Creek that his family owns. --- “It’s just something that my dad always did when we were growing up. He worked, and when he came home that was the first thing we were going to do. We’d go out in the daytime, but a lot of times we’d go out at night, which is a lot easier,” he said. “It’s just a time-honored tradition that we hold true to our culture.” --- He said many people who catch crawdads use traps, but he and his family use homemade gigs, something he also learned to do from his father. --- “The gigs we are using tonight are all hand-forged by my dad. I’m in my 50s and the gigs that we’re going to use, I was 18 when dad made them,” he said. --- Hastings died in 2010 at age 67. He was known as a Cherokee traditionalist and was widely recognized for his work in cultural preservation and as a skilled traditional artisan. He was designated a Cherokee National Treasure in 1991 for his craftsmanship, which included making gigs. --- When gigging, Larry said they never catch more crawdads than they can eat. He said he and his family will determine how many crawdads they need to feed everyone and then they’ll go out and catch that amount. --- “We always leave some either for the next family or next year’s crop, but we never take more than what we need,” he said. “It’s part of the Cherokee way.” --- He said most of the time when he and his family “get together” they go gigging the night before. --- “My son, some of his friends and my daughter, we all go out and they know how,” he said. “We go through whether the water is cold or it’s warm, whether it’s leaches or snakes. They understand there’s a few dangers out there, but it’s something that we’ve done all our lives.” --- The method the Shades use to catch crawdads is not the easiest, Larry said, but it’s their tradition and it’s how he honors the Cherokee traditions and culture. --- “There a lot of easier way to get crawdads, but this is a time-honored tradition for us,” he said. “I’m skilled in what I’ve done and it’s hard for me to do something else.” --- Larry said he’s been gigging as long as he can remember. --- “Ever since dad trusted us and we were old enough to understand what ‘no’ meant and ‘don’t do that,’” he said. “I’m going to say, 5 or 6 years old…at least 46 years.” --- He said years ago catching crawdads was a way to feed one’s family. It’s not like that so much now, but the experience of providing for his family is something he said he would always honor and cherish. --- “My grandparents did it and passed it on to my dad. And you know my grandfather, he forged his gigs, which he passed on to my dad,” Larry said. “Dustin’s (one of Larry’s son) with me most the time and I’m glad that he’s with me and I hope that he carries it on. We all won’t be here…too much longer and we hope the traditions that we have…we carry on to our children and even the friends of my sons and daughters. I hope that they carry on.” --- Larry said if no one has ever tried gigging they are welcome to email him at larry-shade@cherokee.org. --- “I more than welcome you to look me up. Give me a holler. I will definitely take you. We’ll go out one night and I’ll show you the cultural way,” he said. “I invite all Cherokees or any tribal member. If they want to come experience a little history and a little culture.” ---  Catching --- Larry Shade and his family slowly walk through creek waters at night carrying a lamplight, a bucket and a gig. Crawdads feed at night. --- The Shades catch both in shallow and deep waters. “So it just depends on where you find the crawdads. You have to go to them. They don’t come to you,” he said. --- Larry said many people “bait” a hole the night before by throwing out “chum” or something for the crawdads to feed on and draw them with. “If I clean fish, sometimes I’ll throw that in the water and that’s just so the crawdad have food. I don’t go back and bait the hole. What we do is we do it the sportsman way. I don’t cheat nature,” he said. --- Larry said when gigging, get close enough to the crawdad without scaring it, stab the crawdad with the gig in the upper portion of the body because you eat the tail and you don’t want to damage it. He said it’s also important to make sure when hunting at night that one’s light is bright enough to shine through the water and always be aware of your surroundings. ---  Cleaning and Cooking --- After a good catch, Larry and his family clean the crawdads, usually at the creek because it’s just easier. --- “The way we clean ours is we take the back part of the crawdad and pull the back part up and we clean the guts and intestines (out). And then we turn the crawdad around and we’ll find the middle fin and we’ll pull the middle fin. That way the intestinal track will come out. Most the time we’ll tear the legs off because the edible part is the front section that we cook and we’ll break up the tail part and just eat the meat in the shell.” --- After cleaning, he said they soak the crawdads in hot water with about one tablespoon of salt to ensure the crustaceans are clean and preserved until they’re cooked. --- If the Shades don’t cook them that night, Larry said sometimes he’ll place them in just enough water to cover each crawdad with a half teaspoon of salt in a gallon plastic bag and put them into the freezer. --- When they’re ready to cook, Larry said he doesn’t add a whole lot to them, just a little season and cornmeal. --- He said to lightly salt and pepper and add just enough cornmeal to coat each crawdad. --- “Little salt and little pepper and then a little cornmeal and then we’ll fry it,” he said. “I know it’s kind of the unhealthy way, but it’s something that we’ve done our whole lives.”

BRUSHY, Okla. – Breanna Potter is fulfilling her dream of improving her community and surrounding Sequoyah County communities by using a $10,000 “Dreamstarter” grant she received earlier this year. --- She and Cindy Lattimore, Indian Capital Technology Center counselor, met with students from the county the last week of July at the Brushy Community Center. --- Potter, of Akins, said the youth group is called the Brushy Dream Team and focuses on training youths to be leaders in their communities. --- “We’re really big on trying to train our kids to be able to go out into the world and be leaders, whether that means to go out and move away and make a difference in other Native communities or whether it means to stay here and be community leaders or whether they decide to be a teacher or lawyer or they want to serve as mayor one day or maybe even serve on our Tribal Council,” Potter said. --- She said she has already seen the program make a difference in the youths involved because they have become more outgoing or opened up more to their instructors. --- Morgan Robinson, 14, a 10th grader from Vian, was one of the students from Vian, Brushy and Akins who participated in the weeklong program. --- “Today we are learning about our personalities and more about ourselves and finding out about what we want to do for our careers, which I already know,” Robinson said. “I want to go into marine zoology, and on the sidelines I want to be a photographer and work in graphic designs.” --- She said students also learned about applying for financial aid for college, preparing for the ACT test, taking college preparatory courses and gained leadership skills. --- “I got a lot of information that I’m glad to have,” she said. “I know more about what to look forward to, and I’ve gotten a head start I guess.” --- Along with learning leadership skills, the youths were given the opportunity to create a diabetes prevention program, Potter said. An entire day was devoted to wellness, she said, where the students learned about the negative effects of alcohol, especially in Native communities, and learned more about diabetes and the prevention methods that are available. --- Potter said “a good number” of the participating students either have relatives or friends who have diabetes. --- “Sequoyah County has almost twice the national average for diabetics, and the majority of those are Type II (diabetics). We have 1,300 (diabetic patients) that get served at Redbird Health Center every year,” she said. --- In April, Potter was invited to Washington, D.C., to meet with other “Dreamstarter” youths and attend the “Dreamstarter” Academy, where the grant recipients learned how to run their projects. --- “It’s a lot of responsibility. Some of the youth involved in the program are as young as 14. They want to make sure we are well prepared,” she said. --- In July, she returned to Washington for a Tribal Youth Gathering hosted by the White House. --- This is the first class of American Indian youths to receive “Dreamstarter” grants for projects that help them bring their dreams to life. Each of the 10 “Dreamstarter” recipients, who are all American Indian youths under age 30, are working with a community nonprofit on a project to increase wellness that is also supported by Running Strong for American Indian Youth. --- She said that in her “Dreamstarter” application she explained that her “dream” or project was for her community group, the Brushy Cherokee Action Association. Her application also explained how she wanted to use the funding and provided a detailed timeline and budget for how the money would be spent. --- Potter, 21, is a senior at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah majoring in special education with an emphasis in mild to moderate disabilities. She said her goal after graduating in May 2016 is to work in a high-Native population and teach in a junior high or high school. --- For more information about this year’s “Dreamstarters” or to learn how to help jumpstart dreams for Native youth, visit ---  http://indianyouth.org/2015Dreamstarters .

OKLAHOMA CITY – United Keetoowah Band citizen Victoria S. Proctor has been selected as one of three 2015 Minority Scholars Program Scholarship recipients for $10,000, according to a release by the Oklahoma-based law firm Crowe &amp; Dunlevy. --- Proctor is a first-year student at the University of Oklahoma College of Law and plans to use the scholarship for tuition, books and living expenses. --- “I’m really blessed to have received the scholarship,” Proctor said. “Going to law school is a big financial burden and this helps alleviate that.” --- The program provides assistance for minority students in an effort to diversify the profession and is awarded based on academic achievement, need and commitment to the law, according to the organization. The award is dispersed in $2,000 per semester increments as long as the recipient remains in good academic standing. --- To be considered for the award, Proctor underwent a competitive application and interview process with members of the firm. --- “The Minority Scholars Program is a reflection of our long-standing commitment to supporting diversity in the legal profession and encouraging the development of the next generation of legal professionals,” Jimmy K. Goodman, director and Diversity Committee co-chairman, said. “We believe it’s important that the composition of the legal profession mirror the diversity of the communities they serve, and we believe every aspiring minority law student deserves the resources needed to achieve their dreams.” --- Proctor was partly inspired to go to law school after working within the UKB as an administrative assistant for the Corporate Advisory Board and witnessed a lack of Native American attorneys working for her tribe. She credits UKB mentors Tim Brown and Bryan Shade for giving her advice about studying and applying for law school. --- The OU College of Law was Proctor’s first choice, largely because of the Native American Law Program. As part of the program, students can access the Center for the Study of American Indian Law and Policy, which provides counsel to tribal, state and national policymakers and a forum for the interdisciplinary discussion and resolution of problems facing Native American communities. --- Proctor spent her time this past summer working for two firms and is working for the Chickasaw Nation as part of the general counsel. --- She has also been active in multiple organizations, including Organization for the Advancement of Women in Law, Kiwanis International and serving as vice-president for the Native American Law Student Association. She was crowned Miss Keetoowah from 2009-10 and graduated magna cum laude in mass communications from Northeastern State University. --- Proctor will graduate with a juris doctor degree from OU in 2017 and encourages all Native Americans to pursue their education. --- “In order to make a difference and to make a change, I think education is a key component of doing that,” she said. “If it’s something that’s important to you, then you need to do what it takes to succeed.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – While many college students use summer vacation to recharge, Cherokees Alayna Farris and Bryan Shade are undertaking prestigious clerkships in Boulder, Colorado, and Washington, D.C. --- Cherokee Nation citizen Alayna Farris began working for the Native American Rights Fund in Boulder in June and will return in August after 10 weeks with the legal firm. --- NARF specializes in protecting treaties and tribal sovereignty, as well as providing legal representation to Native American tribes and villages, organizations and individuals, according to the organization’s website. --- “I’m really excited for this opportunity to work with NARF,” Farris said. “Growing up you always hear about the good work that NARF does, and how they protect sovereignty and tribal rights, so I applied. I was looking for a way I could get more experience working with Indian Country.” --- Farris said she’s hit the ground running at her clerkship. --- “I’m currently working on analyzing a withdrawal case that is in front of the 9th U.S. Circuit (Court of Appeals),” she said. “Most of my first week was dedicated to working that case.” --- She added that preliminary research for her next project of analyzing voting rights has started. And while Farris was initially worried about the transition, she said she’s found life at NARF enjoyable. --- “The culture here is great,” she said. “I don’t feel like I’m the stranger. I actually feel like I’m walking into a place I’ve been for a long time. I thought I would just be talking to my supervising attorney, Mr. (Matthew) Campbell, but every attorney has talked to us, shared their experiences and gave some really good advice.” --- Farris wanted to become a lawyer after working with the CN Indian Child Welfare Office for more than four years while completing her undergraduate degree at Northeastern State University. In summer 2013, she resigned to begin pursuing a law degree at the University of Arkansas, revitalizing its Native American Law Student Association and opening herself up to possibilities. --- “Indian Child Welfare is what really sparked my interest to go to law school, and there’s always a place for that in my heart,” she said. “I want to make sure that our Indian children have all the protection afforded to them by the law, but now that I’ve been exposed to other areas I didn’t know about. The door is wide open.” --- Shade, a United Keetoowah Band citizen, in working for the National Indian Gaming Commission’s Office of General Counsel in Washington, D.C., where he will remain through the end of July. --- The NIGC is committed to the prompt and efficient regulation of the Indian gaming industry, as well as ensuring the integrity of the Indian gaming industry, according to the organization’s Office of Public Affairs. --- “I’ve been interested in (NIGC) since I made the decision to go to law school,” Shade said. “I knew that this opportunity was out there. I’m sure there were a lot of applicants for the position, but I guess it was always something I knew I was going to try for.” --- Entering his fourth week with NIGC, Shade said he’s settled into the organization. --- “Absolutely everybody in this office has taken me under their wing. This is an amazing group of people. I think they all want to see me succeed,” he said. --- His assignments include reviewing ordinance requests from tribal regulating agencies and assuring that proposed gaming facilities are on tribal lands in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. He has also compared existing and proposed gaming compacts and will soon be working with Freedom of Information Act requests. --- “It sounds kind of cheesy, but every project that I’ve worked on so far has been amazing,” he said. “It was exactly what I had in mind when I imagined what an internship here would be like.” --- Shade earned his master’s degree in business administration from NSU while working with the UKB and CN, where he assisted in completing negotiations with Housing and Urban Development and Indian Health Services. --- “Within those negotiations, I started getting curious about what the other side of the table looked like,” he said. “I saw the hard times we were having in negotiations, and I thought that going to law school, learning to think like the people we were negotiating with, was going to get me a lot further. This opportunity (with NIGC) lets me achieve the goal of seeing the other side of the table.”

BRIGGS, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation’s Community and Cultural Outreach has found a way to help CN citizens and local community members learn more about the Cherokee culture with its Cultural Enlightenment Series. --- The series is held the second Tuesday of each month, and in July it took place at the TRI Community Association W.E.B. Building (Welling, Eldon and Briggs) in Briggs. Those attending watched participants play Cherokee marbles, weave baskets and perform other family and culture-friendly activities. --- CCO Director Rob Daugherty said this is just one of the many communities his department reaches out to within the tribe’s 14-county jurisdiction. --- “This is one of the buildings that we helped start fund along with other departments of the Cherokee Nation,” he said. “In our jurisdiction area we have several of these building and we work with approximately 38 community buildings that we have. We work with way more communities than that, but this is one of them.” --- Daugherty, who watched the marble games, said he’s glad the community has taken up the sport. --- “We’re real proud of this organization here in that they started doing this marbles. (They) picked up one of the old games, and now Cherokee Nation’s coming out here and hosting tournaments,” he said. “The good thing about this game is it doesn’t matter how old you are. It doesn’t matte what size you are. It doesn’t matter what level of skill. This is a game that you’re pretty well even starting out. It looks like it’s a games of just haphazardly movements, but there’s a strategy to this game. They’re playing teams, and you can tell among themselves they’re talking where to move, who to hit, where to sit and so forth.” --- Daugherty said it is also important to use the Cherokee language in the Cultural Enlightenment Series. --- “Language is really big in my department, so one of the things that I have suggested is no matter what you do incorporate Cherokee language in there,” he said. --- John Sellers, TRI Community W.E.B. Association president, said he was glad to have the CN come to the building to show community members Cherokee culture. --- “We attend classes about once a month at the (Cherokee) Nation’s complex and they saw our facilities and they were talking about the old traditional marble games, and we’ve been asking questions about the rules, how you do it. So they come out here to show us and they said, ‘hey, we’ll just have our regular monthly meeting out here and do that,’” he said. “Then, at the same time we got a call and said they had a lady that wanted to do the basket weaving and I said, ‘bring her on.’” --- Sellers said he is thankful to the CN for all it has done for the community. --- “I can’t say enough for Cherokee Nation,” he said. “I mean we couldn’t do what we’re doing if it wasn’t for them.” --- For more information about the Cultural Enlightenment Series, visit ---  www.facebook.com/CNCCO .

PARK HILL, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Albert Eagle, of Stilwell, recently came across a May 14, 1828, Cherokee Phoenix issue. Eagle first saw the newspaper about 40 years ago when his grandmother, Dora Adair, was going through paperwork. --- “Yeah, the last time I saw it was when I was about 13 just before going to high school. My grandmother had it laying on the bed and she was looking through other papers so I asked her ‘what is this?’ And she said, ‘it’s just an old paper I’ve been saving for years and years and years,’” Eagle said. --- Eagle isn’t positive, but from what he could gather, his great-great-great-grandmother, Susie Livers, and her parents, Chulio Livers and Eliza Jackson, brought the newspaper with them when they were removed to Indian Territory on the Trail of Tears in 1838-39. --- He said when he saw it years ago he didn’t think to find out the newspaper’s history, why it was brought or consider how old it was. --- “Thirteen years old, you don’t pay attention to things like that you know. So I left it alone and here about two weeks ago (in April) I was cleaning out an old dresser of hers and there was a bag way in the back,” he said. --- When Eagle grabbed the bag several documents fell out, as well as the newspaper. --- “First thing that popped in my head was that ‘yeah, I remember this,’” he said. “You know when I unfolded it, it tore a little bit so I was trying to be careful with it. What got me the most was the date on it.” --- What Eagle said was most interesting about its age was that it predated the Trail of Tears and Civil War. --- A big question on Eagle and his family’s minds was why his ancestors thought so much of the newspaper to bring it with them on the trail. The 53-year-old said he didn’t think to ask his grandmother years ago why it was brought to Indian Territory, but he wished he had now that she has passed. --- “I kind of wished I did back then though. I would’ve tried to have somebody keep up with it. It’s just something you don’t pay attention to when you’re that age,” he said. --- After speaking with Eagle initially, current Cherokee Phoenix staff members looked at photos of the four-page edition and located the name Walter Adair in an announcement as candidate for the Committee for Coosewattee District. The announcement also contained well-known Cherokees John Ridge and Major Ridge, as well as Tesahdaski and James Foster. --- Staff members contacted Eagle regarding the Adair name and Eagle said he would check into it. Later, Eagle told staff members that Walter Adair was his great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather and possibly the reason the newspaper was kept all these years. --- Although Eagle said he and his family are working out plans for the 187-year-old print, the idea he and his sister, Margaret Wermy, had was to show it off during the Cherokee National Holiday, possibly with the Cherokee Heritage Center. --- “It belongs to my sister, too. We’d like to have it taken care of, you know, and put up for display for the holiday. We’d like to share it with other people, the Cherokees,” he said. “My main concern was to share it with everybody.” --- CHC interim Archivist Jerry Thompson said he was impressed with the newspaper’s quality. To preserve it, Thompson digitized it for Eagle to keep the original in good condition. --- “So for it to be almost 200 years old, it’s in really great condition,” Thompson said. “The document itself is a great record for the time period. From what he had told me and from what we were seeing, he had never seen the inside of the newspaper itself and after digitizing it and him being able to look at the inside of the paper itself, it was pretty revealing. I mean you could see it on his face. And for him to have kept it in his family for this long period of time in the condition that it’s in, that’s really outstanding.” ---  Click here to view the complete scanned 1828 Cherokee Phoenix.

WESTVILLE, Okla. – Guest speaker Luke Williams shared little-known facts about the construction and use of the second Cherokee Female Seminary during the Goingsnake District Heritage Association meeting on April 18. --- In October 1846, Principal Chief John Ross proposed the creation of two Cherokee Nation high schools or seminaries, one for males and one for females. Construction began in 1847 with the male seminary located about a mile and a half southwest of Tahlequah and the female seminary located in Park Hill, about a mile and half south of town. --- “Both of these structures consisted of three-storied brick buildings with classical-style columns on three sides. The buildings measured 185 feet long and 109 feet wide, and each one of these buildings cost in excess of $60,000,” Williams said. --- Some subjects taught at the schools included geometry, Greek history, algebra, geography and vocal music. --- “These rigorous academics prepared young Cherokees to become educators,” he said. --- On Easter Sunday, April 10, 1887, the Cherokee Female Seminary caught fire and was a complete loss. Only the exterior brickwork and the classical brick columns remained standing. Three of those columns still stand in front of the Cherokee Heritage Center. --- A month later, Principal Chief Dennis Bushyhead recommended the reconstruction of the seminary and signed a bill on May 21, 1887, to order its construction on the north edge of Tahlequah near a fresh water source called Hendricks Spring. --- Charles Edward Ilsley of St. Louis, who owned an architectural firm, was chosen to design the building. He completed its design in July 1887, and it called for a three-story brick building that had two main wings in an L shape. The Richardsonian-Romanesque style of the building called for two three-story towers with conical roofs, a five-story bell tower and numerous round-top arches over windows and doors. --- The construction project was to cost $57,500. The CN National Council requested a project completion date of Aug. 1, 1888. Construction began Nov. 3, 1887. Because the nearest railroad was 30 miles away in Muskogee, the construction project relied on materials that were acquired locally, Williams said. --- “Quarries near Tahlequah provided the lime and sandstone necessary for the large foundation stone and the window sills. Yellow pine timber provided the lumber for the joists, the studding and the flooring, and local kilns fired the extra bricks required for this project,” he said. --- In autumn 1888, the council approved an additional $4,000 for completion of the project, which included funding for a wrought-iron fence surrounding it. --- On April 18, 1889, Ilsley transferred the completed building into the hands of the tribe’s building committee, and on May 7 a celebration was held “to celebrate the revival of the Cherokee Female Seminary.” On Aug. 26, the seminary opened its doors with an enrollment of 232 young women. --- Williams said the building contained modern conveniences including indoor toilets, hot and cold water, a steam heating system and a trunk elevator. Also, the building had 356 windows and two 70-foot chimneys to provide ventilation for the building’s boiler. The 98-foot bell tower on the east side of the building stood out on the north side of Tahlequah. --- “The L-shaped building consisted of a main east-to-west wing measuring 226-feet long and 78-feet wide. A smaller north-to-south wing measured 146-feet long and 40-feet wide,” he said. --- The first floor contained a front vestibule that included a fireplace, a hallway that ran down the length of the 226-foot long building, five large classrooms, a parlor, chapel, kitchen, kitchen storage, and a dining room (in the north-south wing), which was the largest room on the first floor. --- The second floor contained only dormitory rooms that lined both sides of the hallways. The third floor contained large bedrooms with closets and smaller bedrooms with no closets. The far northeast corner of the third floor contained the sick ward. --- About three years after the seminary’s construction, the toilets and the building’s sewer system failed. The system was set up to allow sewer to empty into a pit about 300 yards from the building, Williams said. Water quickly filled the pit and water and sewage backed up into the seminary. --- “If that’s not bad enough, this sewer pit was only 100 yards from Hendricks Spring. Remember, this is where they are getting their source of fresh drinking water,” he said. “The Cherokee Advocate referred to the seminary’s plumbing problems as, quote, ‘a health destroyer.’ After several students died and the constant fear of typhoid fever, the Cherokee National Council ordered the indoor toilets sealed. After this closure, the students used a row of outdoor privies that were constructed out on the east lawn.” --- In March 1909, the “dissolving” CN government sold the seminary building to the new state of Oklahoma for $45,000. In September 1909, the doors reopened as the Northeastern State Normal School. --- Today, the building is used for classrooms for Northeastern State University. On May 7, 2014, CN, NSU and state officials celebrated the 125th anniversary of the building being opened on May 7, 1889.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Tribal leaders gathered on March 26 at the Cherokee National Capitol to announce that the nearly 150-year-old building will undergo masonry restoration this spring and summer to ensure the historic landmark remains a part of downtown. --- Scaffolding is already in place on the south side of the building where workers will begin stripping the exterior paint and sealant, reapply mortar and replace any damaged bricks, which should result in a more authentic look for the structure. --- Cherokee Nation Cultural Tourism is overseeing the project at a cost of $500,000, and it is expected to be complete in August in time for the annual Cherokee National Holiday on Labor Day weekend. --- “We are truly blessed to be here with the resources to protect and restore the most-photographed, the most-iconic building in the Cherokee Nation,” said Principal Chief Bill John Baker. “It’s especially a special building to the Cherokee people because it tells of our resurgence in Indian Territory to bring our government back to life when we could have gone about our way and given up, but our people didn’t give up. They went about building this building.” --- The Capitol was built in 1869 and occupied by all three branches of the tribe’s government prior to statehood. Today, it houses the judicial branch of the CN. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also designated a National Landmark. --- Baker said in the early 1990s it was discovered that the building was deteriorating and if something wasn’t done the bricks “would just crumble and completely fall apart.” --- “The tribe was not near as successful or near as blessed then, and the only solution that we could come up with was to seal it and paint it to protect it for better days,” Baker said. --- In 2013, a replica cupola was constructed to bring the building back to its 1870s appearance. Originally, the cupola was used to aid airflow through the upper floors of the building. Over time it was also used for office space as well as a jury room before being destroyed in a 1928 fire. --- Other previous restoration work on the building includes roof repairs with new decking and historic era shingles, restoration of soffits and fascia, a gutter system and updated doors and windows.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Veterans and Cherokee leaders on March 11 celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Cherokee Nation Veterans Service Center. --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker and Deputy Chief Joe Crittenden, a Navy veteran, spoke and served cake to veterans and others. After the ceremony, the center’s staff hosted an open house. --- “I certainly enjoy any event that we have here at the Veterans Center. I’m so proud of this as a veteran, as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and as an office holder in our tribe. I’m proud for what this building represents for all veterans,” Crittenden said. --- During the ceremony, it was announced by Veterans Service Center Manager Ricky Robinson that the CN would soon be organizing a second “Honor Flight” to Washington, D.C. The flight is for Cherokee World War II veterans to enable them to visit the World War II Memorial and other memorials and sites in the nation’s capital. The first flight took place in September when seven Cherokee World War II vets from the area traveled to Washington. --- Robinson also listed the services available to veterans and their families at the center during the anniversary celebration. He said customer service representative Raymond Vann and Robinson are available at the center to assist veterans with paperwork. ---  This veterans center is mainly for Cherokee warriors, but all warriors are invited to it. This can be their home away from their home. ---  Principal Chief Bill John Baker --- Robinson said CNVSC staff can also answer questions about paperwork and whether a veteran or his or her family member is qualified for certain benefits, which saves time. Vann, who is knowledgeable about CN programs and services, is able to determine if a Cherokee veteran would be helped better and quicker by the CN instead of the Veteran Affairs, Robinson said. --- Also, a computer lab is available for veterans or their families, and the center is able to make copies and fax paperwork for veterans or their families. --- The CN Color Guard can be contacted through the center if a family wishes to have the guard attend a veteran’s funeral service, Robinson said, and the center hosts seminars for regulations for being interred in a U.S. National Cemetery such as that one in Fort Gibson. Also, CN Veteran Services staff is able to help families deal with funeral homes to ensure the funeral home does paperwork so a deceased veteran receives their burial benefits. --- The center also hosts a state VA representative who assists veterans with paperwork and is able to scan paperwork and send it directly to the proper department so that the veteran can receive an answer or assistance quicker. A readjustment counselor, Matthew Tiger, has an office at the center through an agreement with VA. Tiger also visits the tribe’s 14-county jurisdictional area to serve veterans. --- “A lot of veterans just want to come in and talk for maybe 10 or 15 minutes. If they have a question that we can’t answer, we do the research and get back to them,” Robinson said. --- He added that the center’s meeting hall is used for functions such as the anniversary celebration, Memorial Day events, a veterans’ dinner during the Cherokee National Holiday and a breakfast and ceremony to commemorate Veterans Day in November. --- Baker said he arrived early to the anniversary celebration to tour the facility and study the display cases in the center that house the memorabilia of area veterans. --- “It is much nicer today than it was a year ago. Now, I travel the 14 counties quite a bit, and I go to a lot of veterans centers...and this veterans center keeps getting better and better and these displays are equal to some of the military museums in Washington, D.C.,” he said. “This veterans center is mainly for Cherokee warriors but all warriors are invited to it. This can be their home away from their home, their place for their meetings, their weddings or their funerals for that matter, and we want to keep it nice. We want to keep it pristine, and we want to keep it alive and growing because we can never repay our veterans for the sacrifices that they have made for the Cherokee Nation and for our country.” --- For more information, call 918-453-5000, ext. 6147 or ext. 5695.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – During a Feb. 7 benefit stomp dance, more than 400 people gathered at the Tahlequah Community Building to raise money for a local Cherokee family that suffered a horrific car accident in January. --- The stomp dance was originally planned to raise money for the Echota Ground, a Cherokee stomp ground in Park Hill. Echota Ground Chief David Comingdeer said the event raised more than $3,500 with half going to the Flynns to help with their expenses. --- Family members suffered multiple injuries and totaled their vehicle in the accident. --- “This evening here in Tahlequah we’ve called all our ceremonial grounds together from the Cherokee Nation, Muskogee Creek, Eucha, Shawnee, Seminole, Seneca Cayuga, even Peoria and Ottawa,” Comingdeer said. “We’ve all come together to help a family, a Cherokee family, a ceremonial family who got in a really bad wreck. We’ve decided to do what we can to help them.” --- The Flynns, driving a 2004 Chevy Trailblazer, were hit in a head-on collision on State Highway 51 by Randall Welch, of Welling, who was driving a 2002 Nissan Frontier. --- Welch was taken by Tulsa Life Flight and admitted for injuries while the driver of the Trailblazer, Jack “Red” Flynn, was taken to Arkansas with external trunk, leg and head injuries. --- Jack’s passengers were Kathy Gann, Jimmy Ross and Nellie Flynn, all family members of Jack. Ross suffered injuries to the head trunk and leg, according to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. Nellie, Jack’s mother, was taken to a Tulsa hospital with similar injuries. --- Nellie was unable to make it to the event because of continual problems with the injuries she suffered. Jack, Ross and Gann were present during the dance along with several other family members. --- Some family members said the accident had put the family in a financial bind with hospital visits and losing the vehicle. --- “Their going back and forth to the hospital. Both him (Jack) and Nellie are going,” Linda Christie, a Flynn family relative, said. --- She said the funds would help with gas, food, travel and anything else unforeseen. --- Jack said without the benefit assistance the family would be forced to suffer more with the financial hardship in which the accident put them. --- The Flynns and Ross will have a long road ahead of them for full recovery, family members said, but they were appreciative of the donations and support from those who attended. --- Stomp dance attendee Celia Xavier said witnessing the fundraiser “felt like a throwback to the way our earlier societies were.” --- “Moving in the same direction, giving a helping hand when one needed it. What affects one, affects all. We are supposed to help each other,” Xavier said. “The antithesis of today’s ‘me society.’ It was interesting to see kindness through the actions of the chief of the Echota Grounds. He is giving half the donations to the Flynn family, who was in dire need of help. It was a moving and spiritual experience.” --- The family is a member of Stokes Ceremonial Grounds, but Comingdeer said it doesn’t matter what ground one is from. --- “They may not be from our ground, but they’re from another ground and we have a lot of respect for each other. We always support each other, try to love and understand each other,” he said. “You can take everything away from us, even our land. You can take all of our corporation away, as long as we still have our beliefs and our tradition we can build a fire, have our dances and take our medicine, speak our language, then we’re still a tribe. Tonight is the foundation of our culture. It’s the foundation of our tribe, and this is how we help each other. --- For those interested in donating to the Echota Ground or the Flynns can do so by mailing a check to Route 4 Box 1570, Stilwell, OK 74960. Make checks out to Echota Ground and indicate in the memo where donation is to go.

SALLISAW, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen and Sallisaw High School sophomore Raven Broussard recently received notice that she’s been nominated to attend the Congress of Future Medical Leaders Conference in Boston. --- The conference is a three-day event set for June 24-26. It is designed for honors-only high school students interested in going into medical research fields or becoming a physician. --- While attending, Broussard will have the chance to meet and hear National Medal of Science winners and Nobel Laureates talk about leading medical research and have the opportunity to speak with top medical schools deans about what to expect at medical school. --- Broussard said she was excited when she first received her invitation letter. --- “I was super, super excited about it,” she said. “I went to my (high school) counselor and I talked to her and she said, ‘Oh, that sounds like a great opportunity, let me see what I can do.’ So, she contacted them. I didn’t really expect for it to come in, and it did, and I was super excited.” --- Broussard, who carries a 4.0 grade point average and is taking advanced classes, said she’s had an interest in the medical field since a young age. --- “I originally wanted to be a neurologist or cardiologist and that was my main thing, was to be a surgeon, but some things have happened, and I’ve decided that I want a less stressful kind of job, and so I’ll be a pediatrician,” she said. --- Broussard said attending the conference would give her an opportunity to learn more about medical-related fields, something she would not normally have the chance to do. She added that she’s proud to represent Oklahoma at the conference. --- “Not only am I distinguished among my fellow students, but I’m going to be a minority,” she said. “It’s all over the U.S., and I’m one of the few that’s going to be representing Oklahoma.” --- Aside from having an interest in the medical field, Broussard enjoys preforming with her high school drama class. --- “I love to act. That’s my thing,” she said. “I’m really artsy and kind of creative. I paint things a lot.” --- Broussard’s mother and fellow CN citizen, Stephanie, said she is proud of her daughter for wanting to help others by striving for a career in the medical field. --- “I was really proud of her because it’s something that she has always wanted,” Stephanie said. “My hope is that she’ll do her goals and come back and work for the Nation and kind of help our citizens. Maybe some other young Cherokee Nation girl and boys will see what she’s doing and want to kind of follow her footsteps.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – A new program to screen for and treat Hepatitis C within the Cherokee Nation is gaining momentum as it moves to the tribe’s seven health centers from its W.W. Hastings Hospital base. --- Dr. Jorge Mera, who is leading the program at Hastings, said he saw the program’s need when he saw the number of patients who had the virus. The virus can cause liver disease or inflammation of the liver, which is the organ that removes harmful chemicals from the blood, fights infection, helps digest food and stores nutrients and energy. --- “When I came here in 2012, one of the reasons that I was hired was to take care of the Hepatitis C clinic. I did find that we had a lot of patients, but unfortunately at that time the possibility of treating the patients was not very good because we did not have very good medications,” Mera said. “The medications that we had were effective, but most people couldn’t take them because of the side effects. Even though I knew we had thousands of patients with Hep C, the amount we could treat was less than 10 percent.” --- New medications have come on the market, he said, that are safer with less side effects that allow more patients to be treated. Now, he said, he can treat 90 patients out of 100. --- Mera said because the number of Hepatitis C patients is in the thousands, he and his nurse assistant reached out to some of the Nation’s seven health clinics to form partnerships to treat that population. The first partnerships were formed with the Three Rivers Health Center in Muskogee and the A-Mo Health Center in Salina, and Mera has since met with a health provider and nurses in each health center. --- Soon, Hepatitis C clinics also will be available at the Wilma P. Mankiller Health Center in Stilwell, the Will Rogers Health Center in Nowata, Redbird Smith Health Center in Sallisaw, Sam Hider Health Center in Jay, and the Bartlesville Health Clinic, which will soon transfer to the health facility being built in Ochelata. --- Also, Dr. Anna Miller, Amanda Hicks and more staff have been added at Hastings to assist with the program. --- Mera said the virus does not always show symptoms, so it is important for people to get screened. A blood test will show if a patient has Hepatitis C. --- “So, who needs to be screened? The latest CDC (Centers for Disease Control) recommendation is for the ‘Baby Boomer’ population, so anybody born between 1945 and 1965 should be screened,” he said. “Anybody who has used intravenous drugs or snorted drugs, even if it was once in their lifetime, should get tested.” --- Also, people who received a blood transfusion before 1992, had an organ transplant, have a history of getting non-professional tattoos and men who have had sex with men should get tested. --- So far, 300 to 400 patients have been evaluated through the program to determine their “urgent or non-urgent need” for treatment, and about 100 of those patients are receiving treatment to cure the virus. However, Mera said, it’s estimated there are 5,000 Hepatitis C patients within the CN, and the program has detected 900 patients. --- “These are just rough numbers, but they’re not far off from the reality. Our goal is to detect the 5,000 and treat the 5,000. It takes a lot of effort and organization,” he said. --- The Hepatitis C epidemic peaked in the 1960s and1970s when intravenous drug use was common, Mera said. --- “It was not perceived as harmful in those times. This is a chronic infection, so it doesn’t give you problems until 20 or 30 years after you’ve had the infection. Now we’re starting to see those patients with those problems,” he said. “Most of the patients are leading productive lives, but it’s important to detect who needs treatment, so they can continue to have a productive life.” --- He said less than 20 percent of patients infected show symptoms. Those people have an acute infection and may feel tired, their skin may turn yellow, may have dark-yellow urine, stomach pain and loss of appetite. Mera said most people who are infected don’t know it, but may experience flu-like symptoms periodically. --- “Not everybody will get sick (who are infected), that’s important to say, but about 30 percent of the people infected will develop severe scarring of the liver in 20 to 30 years, which we call cirrhosis,” he said. --- Other disorders that may occur are skin disorders, kidney disease and arthritis. However, the liver is most affected. --- Mera recommended people wanting to get tested have their primary physicians refer them to him or one of the physicians working with the Hepatitis C program in one of the CN health centers. --- If a person knows he or she has Hepatitis C, call Dr. Mera’s office at 918-458-3381 to make an appointment. --- “If you don’t know your (Hepatitis C) status, ask your doctor to test you,” Mera said. --- For more information, visit ---  http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/C/ .

PARK HILL, Okla. – The Echota Ceremonial Ground operates with the assistance of the Cherokee Nation and with the assistance of its members and other ceremonial grounds in the area. --- The ceremonial ground is on CN land near the Cherokee Heritage Center. It moved to Park Hill in 2001 from Adair County. --- “It (land) was provided by the (Tribal) Council for the relocation of our fire. We were losing the property where we were at, but before we did we started looking for a new home, and the Council offered several pieces of property and we chose that one for our use,” Echota Ceremonial Ground leader David Comingdeer said. “Since then we’ve had a healthy land-use agreement with the Tribal Council and our chiefs.” --- The Echota Ceremonial Ground’s history is older than the state’s, Comingdeer said. It began near the Peavine Community in Adair County and later moved to Coon Mountain, also in Adair County. There the ground struggled as its leadership aged or became ill until the ground was turned over to Comingdeer, who was serving as second chief, in 2002. --- “It’s a struggle to keep the ground going, but it’s very rewarding at the same time,” he said. --- A benefit stomp dance will be held for the Echota Ceremonial Ground from 7 p.m. to midnight on Feb. 7 at the Tahlequah Community Building located at 908 S. College Ave. Members from all ceremonial grounds are welcome for fellowship and fundraising for improvements to the ground. The emcee will be Opv Mack. --- Raffles, cake walks, an auction and drawings for grocery baskets will be a part of the fundraiser. Also, a concession stand will be available for guests. --- Comingdeer said some maintenance needs to be done to the ceremonial ground and he wants to update the restrooms available to members and guests. --- “There are so many people who come out there. We have primitive restrooms, and we just want to improve things a little bit for our visitors and make it more comfortable when they come,” he said. --- Comingdeer said he’s proud that the Echota Ceremonial Ground is still a member of the “Four Mothers’ Society.” He said it is the only Cherokee ground that is still a member of the more than 100-year-old society. --- The society began because Cherokee ceremonial people, along with Muscogee (Creek) ceremonial people, opposed the allotment of the tribal lands during the Dawes Commission allotment period in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The people feared it would open up “surplus lands” to white settlement, which did occur. --- He said several Muscogee (Creek) ceremonial grounds are still part of the “Four Mothers’ Society.” At the ceremonial grounds stomp dances, stickball games, meetings and ceremonies are held. --- “My ancestors from that ground (Echota) and the other core families from that ground, allied with the Creeks,” he said. “To this day, when they have meetings in the Creek Nation, I get invited to meet with the Creek ceremonial chiefs to discuss different issues. The Creeks still acknowledge us as part of the alliance.” --- Comingdeer said he expects to receive support at the benefit stomp dance from Muscogee (Creek) ceremonial grounds and local Cherokee groups. He said members of the Echota Ceremonial Ground also support the Muscogee (Creek) grounds with their fundraisers and events. --- “We are a Cherokee community, and we embody the Cherokee ceremonial culture. We work hard to perpetuate, nor preserve, our ceremonial values and ceremonial ways the way they were passed down to us,” he said. “That’s what makes us a tribe. It’s not enterprises or businesses or whatnot. You can take all that away as long as we still have our ceremonial ground and our language and our ceremonial beliefs, we’re still a tribe. That’s what gives us our federal recognition...so it’s important that we uphold that.” --- Members of the Echota Ceremonial Ground have five dance meetings during the spring and summer with the first dance in April. --- For more information about the benefit stomp dance, call Comingdeer at 918-822-2302.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation’s Tahlequah tag office is settling into its new location at 120 E. Balentine Road after its recent December opening. --- The location sits between the Cherokee Springs Golf Couse and U.S. Highway 62, west of the Curt’s Oil Co. Conoco gas station and east of the Tommy Nix Auto Group, formerly known as Darrell Yates Auto Mall. --- CN Tax Administrator Sharon Swepston said the location provides more lobby room than its prior office and offers more parking. --- “There is a larger waiting room. The lobby area will seat about 50 people now whereas before we could sit maybe 20. So we have a lot larger area for our customers to come in to. It’s a lot nicer area for them to come in to,” she said. “Instead of just having one public bathroom we have two – a men’s and a women’s. That’s better, too.” --- The new location has also retained its television and Swepston said she hopes her office can put it to use in other ways than just informing citizens about what is going on with the tribe. --- “In the future, we may be able to use that as a system to be able to put people’s names up on there where they can tell when it’s their turn,” she said. --- Swepston said the new location also provides citizens more ease while getting tags with its five agent booths and drop-off area. She said citizens seem to enjoy the new building, especially the larger waiting area. --- “Everybody seems to really like it,” she said. “It seems to be going really well and the public seems to be accepting it real well.” --- CN citizen Rebecca Zamora recently visited the office to renew a tag for one of her vehicles. Zamora said the visit was her first at the new location and that it looks and feels nicer than the previous site. --- “I like it,” she said. “It’s a lot nicer and not so on top of each other.” --- Swepston said since the location is still new to citizens the tribe is sending out cards with the office’s address. She added that signs would be going up at the location soon. --- Swepston said the Tahlequah tag office had been at its previous location since 2000. That location, she said, would be used as office space for other tribal departments. --- With the recent opening of the Catoosa tag office, there are now six CN tag offices in the tribe’s jurisdiction. The CN also has tag offices in Sallisaw, Adair, Collinsville and Jay. --- “Hopefully that is better for all our citizens so that they can go out and get their tags and make it a little easier for them to do that,” Swepston said. --- The Tahlequah tag office is open at 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday except on Tuesday when it’s open until 6 p.m.

LINE SWITCH, Okla. – A river cane field located on Cherokee Nation land in southern Adair County got some needed help using fire. --- On land adjacent to Sallisaw Creek, Roger Cain, researcher for the Cherokee Nation River Cane Initiative, joined Cherokee Nation Wildlife Fire Coordinator David Comingdeer and his son Spencer for a “controlled burn” under the native river cane growing next to the creek. --- The river cane project began in 2011 to preserve, map and perpetuate the growth of river cane in the CN. --- “So far we’ve identified 60 acres of river cane on tribal land out of about 18,000 acres. We’re here today on this plot that has been partially poisoned, and we’re trying to correct the problem by burning off the old cane, and hopefully we’ll connect two separate cane breaks together,” Cain said. “Burning cane breaks hasn’t been done since before statehood. Before statehood we were able to burn and do all sorts of stuff as a tribe...so this is pretty unique. We’re doing something other tribes wish they could do, and we’re glad we can do it and protect our tribal resources.” --- Cain said the burn is done in the winter to remove the river cane’s competition. River cane grows in the winter, and if its competition is eliminated it will get a head start in the spring and grow taller and larger. --- When the cane reaches a certain height it will develop a canopy and won’t have to compete as much with other plants around it because it will block out the sun, he said. --- Comingdeer said he and his son attempted a “controlled burn” on Jan. 9, while the conditions were good with good humidity and little wind. However, the “fuel” or leaves needed to keep the fire going were compacted due to recent rainfall. --- “A lot of our native species and our plants that are in this area that we use for our artwork, our basketry, our materials that we harvest for certain things like our medicine...are fire dependent. If you don’t have fire occasionally in those areas, than those native species simply die off. Other invasive species will come in and choke them out,” Comingdeer said. “The fire didn’t carry well through most of the cane itself, but if it doesn’t burn, it doesn’t need fire right now, so we’ll come back when the conditions for fire are a little bit better.” --- Comingdeer said the plants growing in the area near Sallisaw Creek are similar to plants that grew in the Cherokee’s eastern homelands, so that’s why many Cherokee gravitated to the area after the forced removal. --- Another problem for the river cane on this piece of tribal land is cattle are continuously eating the cane and preventing it from growing taller. Cain said the cattle are after the protein in the cane, which is a grass and is 30 to 40 percent protein. On the other side of the fence where the cattle are not able to graze, the river cane is much taller. --- Cain said tribal leaders have pledged to fence in the river cane to prevent the cattle from eating it. --- A third problem for the river cane is poisoning. Some of the cane near the creek was killed by poison possibly used by the rancher leasing the land to kill milk thistle and other weeds in the pasture next to the cane field. Milk thistle can cause nitrate poisoning in cattle and push out beneficial plants. --- “The resulting run off from the poison washed down the field and bisected a canebrake as it washed into the creek,” Cain said. --- River cane can be used to make blowguns, and milk thistle bulbs are used to help make blowgun darts. --- Also, when ranchers mow over larger cane stalks they create spikes that are dangerous to animals and people, Cain added. People cutting cane and leaving spikes is one of Cain’s major complaints and safety concerns in canebrakes. --- River cane was the Cherokees’ plastic, Cain said. It was used for shelter, weapons, mats, chairs, food and supplied material for baskets. --- Unfortunately not much of the river cane found on the 60 acres of tribal land is fit for “traditional art” such as baskets, Cain said, because it has not been taken care of and is attempting to grow under the canopy of trees. River cane once grew 40 feet tall in the area, but now cane growing only 20 feet tall can be found. --- “What we are finding is that river cane is best when a man is working with it and helping maintain it,” he said. “That’s what we’re trying to do here is help its visibility to the sun increase as well as trying something we’ve never done as a tribe in using our traditional fire knowledge to improve the environment.”

EDMOND, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Laurin Keen is a senior at the University of Central Oklahoma who recently helped create a $1,500 scholarship to benefit the current and future Miss Native American UCO pageant winners. --- Keen previously held the title but said when she was Miss Native American UCO it was more of an ambassador position and it offered no scholarship. She said it’s important to have a scholarship for the Miss Native American UCO winner because other pageants on campus have scholarships in place for their respective winners. --- “We tried to get the pageant going for a couple of years and it didn’t really have the support,” she said. “When I came back this semester, I asked again if we could have the scholarship pageant and finally my advisor said ‘yes, you can have it.’ We started planning.” --- Because the pageant was in the planning stages, Keen said she and others raised funds for the scholarship through various outlets. --- “We sold ads. We took donations. My mom made a blanket to auction off and that money went towards the scholarship,” she said. “We have several pieces of art that different artists donated to me at the Cherokee Art Market. I went and just all these really amazing artists donated pieces of work so we could auction those off and that money will go towards the scholarship, also.” --- Keen said the artists’ donations were something that she greatly appreciated. --- “There were several artists that just blew me away,” she said. “Out of the kindness of their hearts they just donated their own artwork and that really touched me. They didn’t have to do that, and I think it’s great that people appreciate education and that they’re supporting Native American women’s pursuit of higher education at UCO.” --- The scholarship is now available to those who win Miss Native American UCO, and Keen said she hopes to see more Native women competing in the pageant. --- “It was really an honor to get to hold that position and represent yourself, your tribe and school,” she said. “We’re all students in college and scholarships help everyone. I think it’s definitely an incentive.” --- Keen said she and others are trying to establish the scholarship pageant as an annual event and hopes it help others in the future. --- “It was really important for me to establish this pageant because I know there are so many great Native American women on our campus, and I really feel like they needed a outlet and an opportunity to showcase their cultural knowledge and everything that they have to share about their own tribes, which is way more than I could have shared about their tribes,” she said. “It’s one thing for me to share about the Cherokee Nation, but to provide this event there were people that saw several cultures and heard several languages.” --- The current Miss Native American UCO, Jessica New Moon, who was crowned on Nov. 7, will receive $750 for each of the two semesters she is Miss Native American UCO. --- Keen graduated from Sequoyah High School in 2011. At SHS, she played sports and was valedictorian of her class. She also received the Gates Millennium Scholarship and other scholarships. --- Keen, an elementary education major, said she attends UCO because of its teaching program. --- “I feel really passionately about education. I think it’s a really important part of my life, and I think it really helps others,” she said. “I just felt like this is my way of giving back to the community, and really how I can make a difference is by being a teacher and being a good teacher because I had really good teachers that really impacted me and that kind of inspired me to go into education.”

PARK HILL, Okla. – In his 38 years of working at the Cherokee Heritage Center, Tom Mooney worked on numerous projects and held various titles, but he retired on Dec. 5 as the center’s archivist. --- He began his CHC career as its historical registrar in 1976, the same year the Cherokee people ratified a new tribal constitution and 10 years after work began on the center. --- “I’ve enjoyed every year here. A lot of my life has been spent here. When you spend that much time some place you make a lot of friends. I’ve been very pleased all the years I’ve been out here,” Mooney said. --- He assisted people with genealogy until 2000, when he began overseeing the center’s massive archive. The archive includes books, newspapers, photographs, Cherokee Nation records from 1948-75 and donated papers from former Principal Chief William Keeler and many other former leaders and CN citizens. --- “When I started here there was file cabinet and that was basically the archives,” he said. “It’s just been the past few years that we’ve really gotten things squared away in our collections.” --- After helping with genealogy, he said he was glad to be able to concentrate on the archives, which now make up two rooms in the museum’s basement. --- The 66-year-old said his favorite document in the archives is a letter written by Ellen Whitmore, the first principal of the Cherokee Female Seminary, which opened in 1851. The CHC nearly sits where the seminary once did. The seminary burned down in 1887, and the center has as its centerpiece the three remaining brick columns of the seminary. --- “She’s writing her family. She’s been offered a job out here. She’s in Massachusetts, and she’s having to make this decision about whether to come out to Cherokee Nation or not,” Mooney said of Whitmore’s letter. “Today, it’s a big challenge for a girl to come from Massachusetts to Oklahoma to take a job. Back then it must have been horrendous.” --- The perils of traveling to Indian Territory by boat in 1850 down the Ohio River to the Mississippi River through Memphis and then through Arkansas on the Arkansas River and into Indian Territory and Tahlequah, where Principal Chief John Ross greeted her, tested her will. However, Mooney said she enjoyed her time leading the seminary. --- Documents such as Whitmore’s letter and others are being scanned and made into digital files so they can be accessed easier without damaging the original document. --- Mooney said before documents were scanned it was up to him “to remember where some box was” to access certain documents. ---  When you spend that much time some place you make a lot of friends. ---  Tom Mooney, Cherokee Heritage Center archivist --- In 2011, Mooney became a certified archivist through the Academy of Certified Archivists. He said at the time he took the certification test as a method of self-evaluation to see if he could pass the ACA test. --- CHC Executive Director Center Candessa Tehee said Mooney has been more than the center’s archivist. --- “He’s really been the backbone of the institution. He has so much institutional knowledge,” she said. “Tom built the archives. He started with basically nothing, and now we’ve got thousands of documents, and he has dealt with so many challenges...it’s really amazing what he has been able to do with so little.” --- One challenge was dealing with flooding in the basement during heavy rains. Tehee said Mooney told her during those times he would sleep on a cot with his arm above his head and his hand touching the floor so when the water came into the basement and touched his hand he would know to get up and vacuum it before it reached the archives. --- “Tom has such a passion for the institution. He has such a passion for Cherokee history, Cherokee heritage, Cherokee culture that he has made innumerable personal sacrifices to be here as archivist to continue to safeguard this collection,” Tehee said. --- Mooney retired a day before his 38th anniversary, which fell on Dec. 6. On Dec. 5, Mooney’s coworkers gathered in the CHC’s museum atrium to honor him for his dedication to the archives and for being a friend. He was presented with an “Unbroken Friendship Mat” made from river cane and woven by Cherokee artist and coworker Betty Frogg. Under the mat, which was enclosed in glass and a frame, read: “Thank you for 38 years of your ‘Unbroken Friendship.’” --- His wife, daughter and grandchildren also attended the honoring ceremony. Mooney met his wife Robin when they both worked at the CHC. --- He said he would miss the people he worked with the most, but he would, of course, also miss the “old documents” with which he has become familiar. --- “It’s been a great place. I’ve enjoyed the ride,” he said.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN, Okla. – Jewell Hummingbird Millsap greets people at the door of the Rocky Mountain Elementary School cafeteria during a fundraiser for a community member battling cancer. --- She could be considered the community’s unofficial ambassador as she welcomes people, a usual site for this Adair County community. --- “She’s a very strong Cherokee woman. She’s the elder of our board, and we rely on her wisdom to guide us with our decisions. She’s very knowledgeable about so many things and of our culture. We appreciate her so much,” Vicki McLemore, Rocky Mountain Cherokee Community Organization president, said. --- Millsap said there are people who watch from “the sideline” when there is a need, but she isn’t one of them. --- “I’m a go-getter and I help in anyway. Sometimes I really try to help somebody and get in their way,” she said with a laugh. --- Along with serving on the RMCCO board, she’s also a member of Echota Baptist Church and does all she can to “serve the Lord faithfully there.” --- She’ also served 16 years as a foster grandparent at the Rocky Mountain Elementary School. Five days a week she helps with the first grade. --- “That’s a program I really enjoy because grandmas always got time to hug kids, and kids always love to hug grandmas. It’s like coming to a rose garden. You start teaching the kids that need help, and you can just see that rose blossoming and blooming. They get excited about learning to read and they come running and say, ‘hey granny, I can read and I can read ‘Green Eggs and Ham,’” she said. “They get so excited when they start learning.” --- She said she prays for help to teach the children who need extra help to learn. --- “A lot of them would be left behind if it wasn’t for us grannies,” she said. --- Millsap, 78, said she’s “a big cook” and enjoys cooking with the other grannies who volunteer at the school and for the RMCCO for fundraisers and activities. --- “We have programs and we put on gospel singings and stuff to make our utility money,” Millsap said. “And then a lot of times we just have free dinners and have games. We have bingo for the elders who like to come out and play that.” --- She also partakes in the Cherokee Nation’s Diabetes Prevention Program, which assists Cherokees in keeping diabetes at bay. --- “It not only keeps me slim and trim, but I help them out with their programs by being active as much as I can,” she said. “I’ve got my fingers in so many fires. If it wasn’t for that though I would be in a wheelchair or I wouldn’t be able to do what I do now. You have to keep active.” --- Hampered by osteoporosis and arthritis, she said if she doesn’t stay active she would “stove up” or her body would get stiff. Part of staying active includes weed eating and mowing the lawn at her church and at the church cemetery. --- “I look at it this way. I serve one of the greatest servants that ever walked this earth and that’s Jesus Christ because he came as a servant to serve, and that’s what I must do,” she said. “I serve whoever needs help in the community. You do the best you can for everybody. To be a servant you must have a willing heart, and you must be available.” --- For all of her community service, Millsap was honored in April in Oklahoma City with the “Karen D. Jacobs Award for Exemplary Community Service.” The award joined others she’s received such as “Granny of the Year for Adair County,” and “All-Around Granny,” which covers 12 counties in eastern Oklahoma. She’s also received pins from Sens. Bob Dole and Robert Byrd for volunteer service. --- Her daughter Suzie Mathis said her mother is “a beautiful lady” who gives people rides to town, donates food, sets with the sick and cooks for community events or families dealing with the loss of a loved one. --- Mathis said her mother and five other women worked in 100-plus degree heat to build a deck on the RMCCO building when Millsap was 75. Last summer, Millsap helped dig a water line ditch when her church had a water leak. --- “Any person or child she has contact with is family and once you’re in blood doesn’t matter, you’re family,” Mathis said. “She’s the most caring person I know. Just talk to her once, and the first thing you get from her is ‘can I help?’”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation Gaming Commission Director Jamie Hummingbird was recently re-elected as chairman of the National Tribal Gaming Commissioners &amp; Regulators, a non-profit organization that promotes cooperative relationships among the commissioners and regulators of tribal gaming enterprises. --- “When I saw the NTGCR and what it was about and its purpose, I thought ‘this is a good way for me to get back to, to make good on the investment my early mentors made in me,’” Hummingbird said. “I can now reach out to other commissioners and say ‘you’re not alone out there. We’re here to help.’” --- NTGCR was founded by tribal gaming regulators to provide information and education and promote an exchange of ideas from tribal regulators from across the country. --- “We get together two times a year and offer up trainings in the areas of audit surveillance, investigations, IT and provide new commissioners and some seasoned commissioners with information and training that everybody would regardless of what jurisdiction they’re in,” Hummingbird said. “We train on federal laws, on compacts. We train on hearing procedures. We train on auditing. We train on anything that a commissioner might need to know to do his or her job.” --- Hummingbird first elected as NTGCR chairman in 2006. He said the organization is a source of support and information. --- “Early on when I started this job in 1998, I had very little knowledge gaming let alone how to regulate gaming,” Hummingbird said. “So when I first took this job I reached out to my counterparts at other tribes and they were very willing and happy to share (public) information with me that got me really up to speed in a very short amount of time as compared to learning it on my own.” --- Hummingbird said during his involvement with NTGCR he has learned a lot about federal law and gaming. --- “Early on when I started, it was just at the very beginning of electronic Class II bingo, and I was very fortunate enough at the time to see all the different court cases that were happening, which our tribe was involved in, go from the federal courts in the state to the appellate courts and all the way up to the Supreme Court and then being able to see all the other court cases that tribes have been involved in or initiated for different types of games,” he said. “I think by having that early foundation and being able to see this industry grow from the bottom up has really been an experience that very few have had, and I’ve been fortunate enough to be one of those people.”

CATOOSA, Okla. – Benjamin Harjo Jr. on Oct. 10 was awarded “Best of Show” at the ninth annual Cherokee Art Market, which Cherokee Nation Cultural Tourism hosted at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa. --- Harjo (Absentee Shawnee/Seminole) of Oklahoma City received the award at an Oct. 10 reception. He won for his painting titled “Ahead of Their Time,” which depicts two artists working on a piece of artwork. --- “Looking at some of the Aztec work where they did repetitious faces and heads, I used the heads at the top and then I show them with their paint brushes putting on the finishing touches,” Harjo said. “Boy, I’m glad I finished that piece now.” --- He said he had no idea he would win with his painting and said he was “very nervous.” He also thanked the artists who influenced him when he was younger. --- “I hoping that the younger generation looks at my work as well as the works of the artists,” he said. --- Harjo has attended eight of the nine Cherokee Art Markets. --- “It’s got some quality people here. It’s not as large as say, Santa Fe Indian Market, which has 1,200 artists, but what brings a lot of people to this show is the prize money,” he said. --- CAM Coordinator Deborah Fritts said 154 artists, with a majority of them being Cherokee artists, from throughout the United States brought works to the market. She said citizens from about 50 federally recognized tribes competed and sold their works at the market on Oct. 11-12. --- Artists competed for $75,000 in prize money in seven classes of art, including Paintings, Drawing, Graphics and Photography; Sculpture; Beadwork/Quillwork; Basketry; Pottery; Textiles; and Jewelry. --- Fritts said the CAM is held to promote Native American culture, educate, and keep art and traditions alive. --- One artist who traveled halfway across the country was Antonio Grant of Cherokee, North Carolina. He brought his shell work such as wampum, necklaces and earrings. --- “These are the traditional shells of this land, of the southeast,” he said. --- He uses “old designs” from the Mississippian Era. His Mississippian-influenced gorget titled “Oldest Game in the Land” won “Best of Class” in Jewelry. --- “They (designs) are like 1,500 years old. They did it with traditional tools. I have to use dental tools to do the same effects,” he said. “The technique of shell carving was lost. There are only a handful of us that do this. There’s a Mr. Dan Townsend. He’s the one who pretty much showed me how to do all of this. He showed me, and I took to it really fast.” --- Grant (Cherokee/Navajo) said this was only his second time to come to the market, but he said he enjoys meeting other artists and seeing their works. --- “I love meeting the artists here and seeing the work they do,” he said. “Every since I was a little boy I was always intrigued by art. I lived in New Mexico. That’s where my mother is from. She’s from the Navajo reservation. They taught all kinds of things like leatherwork, sand work, weaving. So I was familiar with all of that. Plus, she did some of those things. Plus, her family did...silversmithing. My father, he’s from Cherokee, North Carolina. He did all kinds of stone work, sculpting, bone carving. We did it all.” --- Cherokee artist Troy Jackson of Tahlequah won “Best of Class” and “Judges Choice” awards for his clay sculpture “The Gift.” --- “I grew up in a family that is white and Cherokee. I got many gifts from each side,” he said. --- He said his sculpture symbolizes the Industrial Revolution and how it affected Native Americans. --- “You’ll see a lot of gears and cogs on my pieces that are symbolic of the Industrial Revolution. We’ve also been given the gift of nature, so that’s why you’ll also see a lot of fish, which symbolizes more of the abundance of natural things,” he said. “The irony is when we developed the Industrial Revolution, we also hurt nature. We destroyed a lot of our nature.” --- He said the irony is now man uses industry to try to repair damage done to nature. --- The sculpture is 43 inches tall, 15 inches wide and is 5 inches in depth. Jackson said the top portion of his piece, which is a figure of a man, symbolizes someone giving a gift and his faith in God. --- “Basically it’s just a representation of Christ and being a gift to us – to Native Americans,” he said. --- Jackson has attended CAM for eight years and said he enjoys being with other artists and the competition. --- “I’m competitive in my nature, so I like the competition,” he said. “One of the things I always try to do is to learn from other artists and to see what they’re doing, to see how it pertains to my art and how I can better my work.”

PRYOR, Okla. – Cherokee Nation and Pryor officials dedicated a Career Services office on Oct. 1 in the city’s industrial park to help supply a work force for area companies. --- Tribal Councilor Janees Taylor, who represents Dist. 15 that includes Pryor, said the office would be used to help place people in jobs in Mayes County and surrounding counties. The 6,000-square-feet of office space is located in the MidAmerica Industrial Park. --- “We have an industrial park that we’re hoping that we can tap into and help supply their needs for a work force. We’re also going to be doing some career training here, so it’s kind of a general one-stop shop for people that need jobs in this area,” Taylor said. --- She added that the CN had a Career Services office in Pryor, but the location was not ideal and she believes that “a lot of people gave up” before they could find the office. The new office is at 2945 Hwy. 69 A, which is easily accessible from Hwy. 69 and next to the Cherokee Nation Industries building in the industrial park. --- “This office is going to be visible. The companies are going to know it’s here as well as people seeking jobs who are going to be able to find us a lot easier,” she said. “There is a sea of opportunity out here in this industrial park, and I would like to see every Cherokee in this area, that wants a job, to come through our doors and go to work that very day.” --- To assist people seeking jobs, Career Services career navigator Charbrice Evans said the CN recently received a Job-Driven National Emergency Grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. The grant is meant to help people, Cherokee and non-Cherokee, who have been out of work 27 weeks or longer. --- “We can help them with training to try to get them employed, to make them more employable and hopefully get them a good paying job,” Evans said. --- Evans said she counsels people on finding jobs that suit and interest them. If a job seeker doesn’t have the necessary skills for the job he or she is interested in, Evans sets them up with training to get those skills. --- Evans said her office was expecting to hire a person to work with area companies to establish contracts for the on-the-job training so people seeking help through the Career Services office can work at those companies to gain experience and skills. --- “We need this building because we have Cherokee people who are ready to go to work. We don’t open places like this for the heck of it. We open it because the demand is there,” CN Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said. “We are in the middle of one of the biggest economic expansions in the history of the Cherokee Nation. We open it because we’re in the middle of a boom when it comes to jobs.” --- He added that thee Career Services office is situated in an area “that is poised for growth.” --- Career Services Executive Director Diane Kelley said the vision for a Career Services office in Pryor came from Brent Taylor, Tribal Councilor Taylor’s husband, who saw the “significant value” of the tribe having a presence in the MidAmerican Industrial Park. --- “He felt like this is where we needed to be, and we’re very excited about today’s event. It’s long overdue,” Kelley said. “We’ve already had contact with some of the businesses here asking us to come and visit with them about trying to recruit people for the hard-to-fill jobs.” --- She said the tribe was also expecting to open a one-stop shop on Oct. 15 in Sallisaw to provide access to various CN programs in one building, including Career Services. --- “We just opened an (Career Services) office in Tulsa, which is a new office. It’s the very first time the Cherokee Nation has had an office in Tulsa. We’ve had a lot of phone calls, a lot of people walking in,” Kelley said. “It was established to help with the Macy’s project in the Owasso area. It’s also an opportunity to roll out our Job-Driven National Emergency Grant.” --- Pryor Mayor Jimmy Tramel said the city’s partnerships with the CN and the industrial park will allow people in the area to get the help and training they need to have a career working close to home. --- “When you look at this facility what do you see? You see a partner in the Cherokee Nation. You see a partner in the MidAmerica Industrial Park. You see a partner with all of the families and all the communities we have here,” he said. “I’m blessed to be the mayor of such a great community and have such great partners, and I want to say thank you to the Cherokee Nation.”

SALINA, Okla. – Public art created for the Cherokee Nation’s A-mo Health Center by Cherokee artists Bill and Demos Glass was carefully delivered by crane to a prominent place in front of the clinic on Sept. 3. --- Though Bill insists Demos created the stainless steel “Prayer Feather,” Demos said he collaborated with his father to create the 8-foot, 2-inch tall and 24-inch wide piece. --- “Dad and I wanted to do this symbolic ‘Prayer Feather’ for our clinic in Salina because the staff is very friendly and courteous. We also wanted to do this in loving remembrance of my grandmother Jean Justice Glass, who was a trained Army nurse,” Demos said. “I primarily designed the feather, and he had a ceramics portion in it. The ceramic’s got an inset detail with a nice four (crossed) logs motif. It’s just our symbol for prayer.” --- The material used was fabricated stainless steel, so it began as a sheet of steel that had to be cut and welded. Demos said he and his dad spent the past five months working on it and that working with stainless steel is challenging. --- “It’s not going to let you do everything, so you got to use a lot of manipulation,” he said. --- He said after the piece was welded together, he hand polished it, which can sometimes take months. --- “I’m still planning and trying to get some of the time cut down in different processes, so I’m always researching. That’s what my whole philosophy is on art. I’m a contemporary artist, and I’m going to continue to research the boundaries of what I can do because it’s exciting to me,” Demos said. “I think the Southeastern designs are the perfect platform to use fabrication techniques.” --- He said it is a benefit to use the minimalist, and sometimes intricate, designs of Southeastern designs and art used by Cherokee people in ancient times. --- Gina Olaya, Cherokee Nation Businesses director of cultural art procurement, said the Glasses were commissioned to do the “Prayer Feather” for the clinic. --- “Bill Glass is a patient at the Salina Clinic. He thought it would be good to have some place where people could actually say a prayer as they’re walking into the building, so that’s how the idea for the ‘Prayer Feather’ sculpture started,” she said. “I’m excited about this. I’m excited for the clinic.” --- Olaya said there is a CN law that allows for 1 percent of construction or renovation funding to be set aside to procure Cherokee art for the tribal building being constructed or renovated. --- “We had some money left over from a couple of projects that we pulled together, and those leftover funds are what’s funding these “Prayer Feather” sculpture projects,” Olaya said. --- Three “Prayer Feathers” are being created at a cost of $76,000. A second “Prayer Feather” will be placed at the renovated Redbird Smith Clinic in Sallisaw, and a third one will be placed at the new W.W. Hastings Hospital in Tahlequah when it is constructed. --- “The overall design of it will be the same, but the tiling that the Glasses are putting on the bottom of the sculpture will be different at each one of the facilities,” she said. --- Olaya said she would work with the Glasses to determine the wording for the plaques that will be placed at the bottom of the three sculptures to explain the artwork. --- CN Health Services Executive Director Connie Davis said the sculpture is “absolutely beautiful.” --- “I think the important thing is that a patient here was inspired and felt like they wanted to contribute something to the clinic,” she said. “Mr. Glass spoke of how he appreciated the care the staff here delivered to him and his family, and I think that just shows the tightness of this community and how well the staff does take care of its patients.” --- Demos studied metalsmithing and sculpture at the University of Southern Illinois. He shares an art studio with Bill in Locust Grove, located south of Salina. --- Demos said he and his father put their thoughts together to come up with an idea that represented prayer. --- “We know that when you go through the health care system sometimes you’re not really looking forward to going there, so we just thought it would be a nice thing,” Demos said. “Public art can affect people just by walking by it, we believe. So, that’s what we are trying to do. We’re trying to create good feelings here.”

TULSA, Okla. – Cherokee Nation officials announced a six-figure partnership with Gilcrease Museum on Sept. 11 to create a special Cherokee exhibition in 2017. --- The exhibition will display an estimated 100 items of Cherokee history from the museum’s collections. To help fund the exhibition, CN officials donated $100,000 to the museum during a ceremony. --- “We are celebrating a new milestone with the Cherokee Nation with an effort to provide more education about the emergence of the Cherokee Nation following removal – a very amazing story of unification that has led to growth that has led to a remarkably vibrant Cherokee Nation today,” University of Tulsa President Steadman Upham said. “We take seriously the stewardship charge of all of the records we keep.” --- The City of Tulsa owns the museum, but the university has operated it since 2008. --- The museum possesses 11 lineal feet of the John Ross Papers that chronicle major events during the former principal chief’s life, including the tribe’s struggle against forced removal to Indian Territory in 1838-39, internal violence with post-removal factionalism, the tribe’s unification, the Nation’s rebuilding in Indian Territory and the American Civil War that devastated it. --- Duane H. King, director of the museum’s Helmerich Center for American Research, said the dates that will be covered by the “Emergence of Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory” exhibition are 1828-66, which coincide with Ross’ tenure. Ross was principal chief for 38 years, longer than any other person in tribal history. --- “It’s commendable that the leadership of the Cherokee Nation...understand the importance of education and the importance of sharing the Cherokee story with the world,” King said. “Our partnership and collaboration with the CN will last many years.” --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker said the donation is a way he and the Tribal Council can fulfill part of their oaths of office to carry on “the culture, heritage, traditions and language” of the Cherokee people. --- “This is one small way we can help fulfill our obligation with good partners that we know will tell the story accurately – will tell the story that will allow people to come and learn a little more about who we are as a people, about who we are as a tribe, about where we came from and about where we’re going,” Baker said. “It’s absolutely our honor and privilege to work with Gilcrease and with TU to carry on a mission that is a passion to all concerned.” --- Most items for the exhibition will come from the Gilcrease collection, but museum officials also plan to showcase significant Cherokee items from other museums. Among the items slated for display are portraits of famous Cherokee leaders and other art and artifacts reflecting the emergence of the CN in Indian Territory. --- Museum officials will work with Cherokee Nation Cultural Tourism in the exhibition’s development. Much of CNCT’s work during the past six years has been on the time period in Cherokee history that will be showcased in the exhibition. --- In November 2013, CN officials contributed a collection of more than 2,000 pages handwritten by Ross for preservation. The project complements an ongoing partnership between Cherokee language translators and Gilcrease Museum to translate Cherokee documents to English for the first time. --- “The story of the emergence of the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory is the story of triumph over adversity. It’s the story of success in the face of tragedy, and it’s one of the most poignant accounts in the annals of recorded history,” King said. “It’s a story we want to share with the public, and we believe it will generate considerable interest locally, regionally and nationally.” --- Gilcrease Museum is one of the country’s leading facilities for the preservation and study of American art and history. It houses a large collection of Native American art and artifacts as well as thousands of historical documents, maps and manuscripts.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Principal Chief Bill John Baker gave the annual State of the Nation address on Aug. 30 at the Cherokee Courthouse lawn with a key message that 175 years after Cherokees walked the Trail of Tears, the Cherokee Nation is not just surviving in northeastern Oklahoma but thriving. --- Baker said the red brick courthouse is a symbol of the strong spirit living within the CN because people who had just experienced one of the worst tragedies in American history built it. --- “It was 175 years ago, we arrived here in eastern Oklahoma and began our greatest chapter – building the largest, most advanced tribal government in the United States,” he said. “Our ancestors were pulled from their homes in the east, forced into stockades and marched here to Indian Territory by a federal government that tried to brutally extinguish us. But in 1839, right here in Tahlequah, we reconstituted our government and we rebuilt our schools. We rebuilt our courts and recreated the commercial success we had in the southeast.” --- Baker thanked Deputy Chief S. Joe Crittenden, members of his Cabinet and the Tribal Council for working for the Cherokee people and for helping place the CN on a strong footing. --- “And we commend all our employees at the Cherokee Nation and say to each and every one of you, wado. We could not have done it without you,” he said. ---  We believed the purpose of a good government, a strong government and a fair government is to make life better for its citizens. ---  – Principal Chief Bill John Baker ---  Baker also highlighted the investments the CN is making to benefit the Cherokee people such as building new homes, expanding health centers and services and creating jobs. --- “As principal chief, my goal is a simple one: make the lives of Cherokees better, and do it every day. Every decision is based on that goal. That is the definitive mission,” he said. “We believed the purpose of a good government, a strong government and a fair government is to make life better for its citizens. And we are succeeding.” --- More homes, better health care and increased hope through education and jobs are a result of the tribe’s investments in its people, he added. One of the highlights of that investment is the number of Cherokees the CN is employing in its government and businesses. --- “We employ more than 9,000 people in northeast Oklahoma, and more than 80 percent of them are Cherokee, compared to less than 70 percent three years ago,” he said. “That’s more than 1,200 (who) are Cherokees working for their tribe. That’s more Cherokees taking home paychecks to their families, and 1,200 more Cherokees who know their tribe is here for them.” --- All of the tribe’s successes have a $1.3 billion dollar economic impact on Oklahoma, he said. --- “As the largest employer in the 14 counties, we are the engine that is driving this economy,” Baker said. “Across the 14 counties, we’ve rebuilt roads and torn down crumbling bridges, rebuilding them from the ground up.” --- He provided examples of the tribe’s work in communities such as expanding waterlines in Nowata to provide safe drinking water, building a water tower in West Siloam Springs and completing water sanitation projects in Oaks and Locust Grove. The CN also continues to give annual cash donations to volunteer fire departments in the tribe’s 14-county jurisdiction. --- “These investments help better people’s lives. The Cherokee Nation has proven time and time again to be the critical piece in what drives prosperous communities,” he said. --- About a year ago, Baker announced a plan to overhaul the CN’s health system. Four health centers in Ochelata, Stilwell, Sallisaw and Jay are under construction or are finished. Also, the CN has budgeted more than $60 million for a new hospital in Tahlequah. --- “Our casinos have grown to be very profitable. So we called for $100 million dollars from our casinos to be use for new health facilities for our people,” he said. “Having profitable casinos is wonderful, but it is useless if it doesn’t benefit our people in the ways they need it most, like health care.” --- Baker said he believes the tribe’s ancestors would be proud of the progress being made and where the tribe is headed. --- “It was 175 years ago that hope carried our people through unimaginable hardship,” he said. “Our ancestors would be proud of where we have been, the progress we are making today and where we are going. We owe it to them to continue and protect that sacred legacy.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Sunday Plumb of Tahlequah was named Miss Cherokee 2014-15 at a leadership competition held Aug. 23 at the Cornerstone Fellowship Church. --- Plumb, a University of Arkansas senior, receives a $3,000 scholarship, and for the next year will represent the Cherokee Nation as a goodwill ambassador to promote the government, history, language and culture of the Cherokee people. --- The 21-year-old competed against four young women for the crown. During the Miss Cherokee Leadership Competition, contestants were judged on their use of the Cherokee language, cultural and platform presentations as well as impromptu interviews. --- “It was such an honor to compete with all of these women. I truly believe every single one of them would be an awesome candidate, but I’m really excited I won,” Plumb said. “It’s such an awesome feeling to be able to represent the Cherokee Nation as Miss Cherokee.” --- Plumb is the daughter of Loyal and Susan Plumb of Tahlequah. She is studying animal science at Arkansas. She is a member of the university’s Native American Student Association and volunteers for Girls Scouts of America. She enjoys gathering traditional foods, shooting blowguns, weaving baskets and making Cherokee tear dresses. --- For her cultural presentation, Plumb explained the history and cultural significance of the tear dress using a dress she made. --- “It took be approximately 41 hours to complete my tear dress,” she said. --- For her platform, she wants to tackle the issue of low graduation and retention rates of Native Americans in college compared to other ethnicities. She said a program that brings together Cherokee college students with high school juniors and seniors to tell them what they can expect in a college environment, both socially and academically, would help retain Cherokee students and help them graduate. --- “The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that for every 100 Native American or Alaska Native kindergarteners, only seven will earn a bachelor’s degree, opposed to 34 out of every 100 Caucasian kindergartners. Although academics are an issue, I don’t think it’s the main cause of the high Native American dropout rate,” Plumb said. “I believe Native Americans have a hard time staying in college for many reasons – not being prepared to maintain your own schedule, adjusting to much less family time, not knowing how to properly study in a college environment, having too much or too little social time and encountering negative attitudes towards Natives that you’re not used to dealing with.” --- She said many Native American students she has spoken to experienced surprisingly negative attitudes about Native American cultures. Instead of getting frustrated, she said it’s up to Native students to help change those negative perceptions. --- “If I had prepared for these interactions, I would have had a smoother start to my college career,” she said. “Because Cherokees are very familial, it’s a hard transition from being around your extended family constantly to being around people you don’t know.” --- Miss Cherokee first runner-up was Ja-Li-Si Pittman, 20, of Tahlequah, who earned a $2,000 scholarship. Second runner-up was Nina Ashley Hopton, 22, of Salina, who earned a $1,000 scholarship. The other contestants were Elizabeth Burns, 18, of Claremore; and Ashley Miller, 21, of Stilwell. --- Pittman is attending Northeastern State University in Tahlequah and majoring in cellular biology. Hopton attended Rogers State University in Claremore and graduated in May after studying general liberal arts, Native American studies and elementary education.

BY JAMI MURPHY --- Reporter --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – On July 12, 1839, Cherokee people known as the “Old Settlers,” who relocated west prior to the Trail of Tears, and the “Eastern Cherokees,” who were forced into Indian Territory on the Trail, signed the Act of Union unifying all Cherokee as one political body. --- To celebrate the act’s 175th anniversary, Cherokee Nation officials and others gathered July 8 at the Capitol Square to discuss the history behind the signing and plant a dogwood tree to commemorate it. --- According to CN Communications, the dogwood holds cultural significance to Cherokees as it can be found as far east as Tennessee and Georgia, across the Trail of Tears, as well as in northeast Oklahoma. --- During the event, CN Attorney General Todd Hembree asked how was it possible to discuss a peaceful union during a “state of upheaval that the Cherokee people found themselves 175 years ago.” --- “History tells us what our ancestors did. They forged ahead. They found a way. This Act of Union was not born out of a desire for good government. It was born out of necessity,” Hembree said. “Because if we didn’t come together at that point in time, under those circumstances, all that we fought to preserve could have been lost. It was not just advantageous to unite, it was essential. And that is what happened here, 175 years ago.” --- He said two branches of Cherokee family became one again. --- “One government, one people. As the act states, ‘we agreed to form ourselves into one body politics, under the style and title of the Cherokee Nation.’ Just as it was forged 175 years ago, it remains true today. The Cherokee Nation is here, we are strong and we are one,” Hembree said. “One hundred seventy-five years later in some ways we are still not united. This should change. We should learn from our ancestors and embrace the sense of community and respect that was so eloquently put forth in document we celebrate today. We should think like Cherokees, but more importantly, we should act like Cherokees.” --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker said the day the Cherokee people came together to sign the Act of Union is an important day we celebrate because we remember our ancestors. --- “As a people and as a government, the Cherokee Nation rebuilt itself in Indian Territory after our forced removal. Our ancestors suffered abuse and loss 175 years ago, yet they never lost the will to endure,” he said. “In our new home – present-day Oklahoma – the Cherokee people rebuilt a sophisticated society with a court system, a government administration, educational institutions and successful commerce. Today, we are a thriving sovereign government with a living culture because our ancestors were strong enough and visionary enough to ensure the Cherokee Nation would survive.” --- He added that the Cherokee people are stronger together than they are separated, and the Act of Union helped to put aside the differences of the Eastern and Western Cherokees. --- “It was when they came together and said ‘we are one. We’re going to create a government for all Cherokee.’ And it was with that union that came the greatness of the Cherokee people,” Baker said. --- Act of Union of 1839 --- WHEREAS, our fathers have existed as a separate and distinct Nation, in the possession and exercise of the essential and appropriate attributes of sovereignty, from a period extending into antiquity, beyond the records and memory of man; and whereas, these attributes, with the rights and franchises which they involve, remain still in full force and virtue; as do also the national and social relations of the Cherokee people to each other, and to the body politic, excepting in those particulars which have grown out of the provisions of the treaties of 1817 and 1819, between the United States and the Cherokee Nation, under which a portion of our people removed to this country, and became a separate community, (but the force of circumstances have recently compelled the body of the Eastern Cherokees to remove to this country, thus bringing together again the two branches of the ancient Cherokee family) it has become essential to the general welfare that a Union should be formed and a system of government matured, adapted to their present condition, and providing equally for the protection of each individual in the enjoyment of all his rights. --- Therefore, we, the people composing the Eastern and Western Cherokee Nation, in national convention assembled, by virtue of our original unalienable rights, do hereby solemnly and mutually agree to form ourselves into one body politic, under the style and title of the CHEROKEE NATION. --- In view of the Union now formed, and for the purpose of making satisfactory adjustments of all unsettled business which may have arisen before the consummation of this Union, we agree that such business shall be settled according to the provisions of the respective laws under which it originated, and the courts of the Cherokee Nation shall be governed in their decisions accordingly. Also, that the delegation authorized by the Eastern Cherokees to make arrangements with Major General Scott, for their removal to this country, shall continue in charge of that business, with their present powers, until it shall be finally closed. And, also, that all rights and titles to public Cherokee lands on the east or west of the river Mississippi, with all other public interests which may have vested in either branch of the Cherokee family, whether inherited from our fathers or derived from any other source, shall henceforth vest entire and unimpaired in the Cherokee Nation, as constituted by this Union. --- Given under our hands, at Illinois Camp-ground, this 12th day of July, 1839. --- By order of the National Convention.

BY WILL CHAVEZ --- Senior Reporter --- GIDEON, Okla. – Glen and Kay Thompson have been caring for foster children in their northern Cherokee County home for nearly 10 years. The couple accepts foster children in the custody of the Cherokee Nation’s Indian Child Welfare and Oklahoma’s Department of Human Services even though they’ve adopted seven children since 2008. --- In 2008, they adopted siblings Hal, Jolene, Joshua, Jonathan, Roshaun and Joaquin, who they had taken in previously as foster children. They also recently adopted Nelvin, 8, who is disabled and requires special care. The seven children range in age from 8 to 13 years old. --- “To me, really there’s no more trouble with 10 of them than there is with two of them. The only difference is when you go to the table you’ve got less room with 10 than with two. At the table and the laundry room, that’s where you notice the difference,” Kay, a CN citizen, said. --- Through the years, the Thompson house has expanded to add bedrooms for their children and later foster children. Kay and Glen also raised four children of their own and have eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. --- The Thompsons began taking in foster children in 2006 and have fostered more than 40 children. Kay said she thought of taking in foster children earlier than that and took classes on caring for them, but then changed her mind. --- “I was afraid I wouldn’t want to let them go. I thought if they had to go back I’d be a basket case. But then I thought if they can live through rough times, surely I can tough it out,” Kay said. “I just thought every once in a while a kid needs a place to go where it’s safe and they can have fun and get well fed. Everyone of them gets spoiled rotten.” --- She said so far it hasn’t been too difficult letting go of her foster children because most of them have gone on to live with relatives who took care of them or went back home to their parents. --- “I have contact with almost every one of them. “I’m really very fortunate. I can usually find out what’s going on with any of mine (foster children),” she said. --- Some biological mothers of the children the Thompsons have fostered have “friended” Kay on Facebook so they can send her photos of the children and keep her updated on how they are doing. --- “They (mothers) tell me they love me, and that means a lot. And they tell me thank you, and I tell them ‘I did what I could while you couldn’t do it,’” she said. “I try not to be judgmental because everybody can blow it and make mistakes.” --- Kay said the most enjoyable part of being a foster parent is watching the children grow and learn, and helping the children overcome their shyness and fear of leaving their homes is something she’s proud of. --- She said if she were to advise people who are thinking about accepting foster children, she would tell them they need a sense of humor, patience and endurance because some children bring emotional problems. --- “Sometimes some of their problems...can make you want to climb up on top of the house and never come down. You have to realize they are really struggling and they are having a problem and it’s hard on them,” she said. “You’re only having to deal with their problem. They’re having to live with it.” --- She also cautions people not go into foster care for the money provided for each child’s care. It’s the wrong attitude to have, she said. --- “If you do foster care right, there is no money in it. It doesn’t pay good, and that’s no reason to take a kid. You’ve got to want to help them,” she said. “It’s just gratifying to be able to watch them become normal children. That’s the most satisfying part for me, just seeing them be all that can be and be normal kids.”

BY STAFF REPORTS --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation recently recognized Dennis Sixkiller’s 10-year milestone as radio show host of “Cherokee Voices, Cherokee Sounds,” which is an hour-long program in both the Cherokee and English languages and includes Cherokee music, interviews with elder speakers and information on CN community news. --- In July 2004, Sixkiller broadcast his first radio show. “Cherokee Voices, Cherokee Sounds” is the only program in Oklahoma to air in the Cherokee language. --- “It was the first time I recorded a radio show, and I was so nervous. I had no clue what to say,” Sixkiller said. --- Sixkiller, a native of Jay, grew up with Cherokee as his first spoken language. He was not exposed to English until first grade. He learned to read and write the Cherokee syllabary in 2001 through CN classes. He started working for the tribe 23 years ago before being approached to host the radio show. --- “When I was first asked to do the program, I thought it was a joke,” he said. “But when offered the opportunity again I said I would try, and I’ve been trying for 10 years now.” --- Sixkiller now works in the Communications Department, recording his shows weekly and works part time in language translation. --- Since the program started airing, it has exposed the Cherokee language and culture to people around the world. --- “It may be the only place outside of the Cherokee Nation for many people to hear the language,” Sixkiller said. “I’ve had people call from as far away as Canada and Australia to say they listen. One guy called from Canada to say hearing all the Cherokee songs on the show is so refreshing that it’s like standing in a shower. People from everywhere say they like to listen.” --- The radio program airs on five stations within the Nation’s jurisdiction and can be heard on ---  http://www.cherokee.org/News/RadioShow.aspx . --- Tahlequah --- KEOK 102.1 FM – Sundays, 8 to 9 a.m. --- KTLQ 1350 AM – Sundays, noon to 1 p.m., and Wednesdays, 5 to 6 p.m. --- Claremore --- KRSC 91.3 FM – Sundays, noon to 1 p.m., and Saturdays, 8 to 9 a.m. --- Vinita --- KGND 1470 AM – Sundays, 9 to 10 a.m. --- Bartlesville --- KWON 1400 AM – Sundays, 9 to 10 a.m.

BY WILL CHAVEZ --- Senior Reporter --- MARBLE CITY, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation on June 27 pledged $120,000 to Dwight Mission in Sequoyah County for restoring and preserving its schoolhouse that was built nearly 100 years ago. --- Peter Newbury, Dwight Mission Camp and Conference Center executive director, said the tribe’s gift would “catapult” the organization into the future because the Walton Family Foundation in Bentonville, Ark., will match it. --- “That 120 becomes 240 and that helps us with this building (schoolhouse), and that’s the focus right now,” Newbury said. --- After renovations, the three-story schoolhouse will be a heritage center and have a museum and office space. The third floor’s 200-seat auditorium also will be renovated. --- The schoolhouse was built in 1917 and was the primary school for the mission from 1917 until 1948 when the school closed. In the 1980s and 1990s, the building hosted Dwight Mission summer camps. --- “The building is incredibly sound and ready to be reborn,” Newbury said. --- During a ceremony, CN officials joined Dwight Mission officials and community members to celebrate the pledges made by the tribe and the Walton Family Foundation. --- “I’m proud to share with you today that Cherokee Nation, along with Cherokee Nation Businesses, our business arm is pledging $120,000. Making those dollars go even farther is a match from the Walton Family Foundation. That’s tremendous,” Deputy Chief Joe Crittenden said. “Dwight Mission played a valuable role for Cherokee youth in northeast Oklahoma. When the mission was built in Indian Territory, it was one of the first schools for Native children. --- For multiple generations of Cherokee children this schoolhouse was part of their growth and their development. That is why it is so important to support its preservation today.” --- Dwight Mission was established in 1820 near Russellville, Ark., but relocated in 1830 to its present-day site near Marble City. It is Oklahoma’s oldest school. --- Named in honor of Rev. Timothy Dwight of Yale University, the mission “has added luster to the name by the great educational work accomplished among the Cherokee Indians,” according to the Chronicles of Oklahoma. --- Warren Schaub of Oklahoma City attended the ceremony in honor of his grandfather Frederick Schaub, who came to Indian Territory in 1895 from Parsons, Kan., as a circuit minister for five Cherokee churches. After ministering to Cherokee people for five years, Dwight Mission leaders asked him to stay and reopen the school. --- “It was opened and closed a lot, but it was closed at the time. They talked him into opening the place and getting it ready. He and a helper did that,” Schaub said. --- Frederick supervised Dwight Mission from 1900 to 1911 when he had to move to New Mexico because his wife needed to live in a drier climate because of her health. Warren Schaub’s father, Dwight, was born at Dwight Mission. --- The Indian Mission Training School served students for 119 years, offering practical instruction, academics and religious teaching until it closed in 1948. It reopened in 1951 as a camp and conference center and continues to serve thousands of guests each year. --- Today, buildings are available for rent for family reunions, conferences or other events and summer camps are held for youth, Newbury said. --- “Basically, if you need a place to meet, eat, and sleep, we’re that place for you,” he said. --- Dwight Mission is a nonprofit facility overseen by two boards: Dwight Mission Inc. and Agency for Dwight Mission.

BY TESINA JACKSON --- Reporter --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – To improve the Cherokee language in it, the Cherokee Nation Translation Department is editing the Cherokee New Testament, which the American Bible Society translated and published in 1860. --- “It was published in 1860, and it has been reprinted ever since,” Roy Boney, CN Cherokee Language Program manager, said. “The edition from the American Bible Society had some misspellings and other minor errors in it that many Cherokee speakers have noted over the last 140-plus years.” --- Translator specialist Durbin Feeling and his brother, Russell, have been serving as the primary editors with input from the rest of the Translation Department. --- “A lot of the things we say in English doesn’t translate the way people think,” Durbin said. “Our language (Cherokee) is very, very descriptive.” --- The original edition of the Cherokee New Testament did not have the red lettering, which represent the words spoken by Jesus. Once the project is complete, it will be a corrected edition of the 1860 translation with the words of Christ highlighted in red. --- “We’re finding some words that possibly they used back then that we don’t use anymore here,” Durbin said. “We go ahead and use it anyway if it goes with the English translation, if it makes sense. But there are some words that we’ve lost since the 1800s.” --- Boney said that in the 1800s several people, including Principal Chief Charles Hicks; Cherokee Phoenix Editor Elias Boudinot; missionary Samuel Worcester and Cherokee Presbyterian minister, politician and Cherokee Phoenix Assistant Editor Stephen Foreman worked on the Cherokee New Testament. --- When the current project is complete, which has not been determined, Jeff Edwards of CN Language Technology will create an ePub of the Cherokee New Testament for free distribution. An ePub is a free, open standard for digital books, which will allow the document to be readable in a variety of eBook readers. --- Russell said that putting the Cherokee New Testament in eBook format would hopefully generate an interest in younger people to pick up the Bible and read it. --- The Cherokee Language Program will also look into printing the Cherokee New Testament in a book format, which will include a foreword from the Translation Department describing the process that went into editing the translation and a history of publication of the Cherokee New Testament since the invention of the syllabary by Sequoyah. --- “Future generations could have something that we never had,” Durbin said.

BY STACIE GUTHRIE --- Reporter --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation Transit recently added a Stilwell-to-West Siloam Springs route to the KI BOIS Area Transit System for CN employees and citizens to ride at reduced costs. The KATS route was expected to begin June 17. --- CN Transit Director Michael Lynn said the route was created with CN Career Services. He said Career Services helped create CNT’s routes because it trains staff for different tribal casino operations throughout the CN jurisdiction. --- “One of the routes from Tahlequah to Catoosa, as well as the Stilwell to West Siloam (Springs) that just started, were through Career Services,” Lynn said. “In fact, Career Services are actually funding those particular routes.” --- Both routes fall under the fixed-route category, which means the routes are open to the public and available to those traveling to exact locations in certain timeframes. For tribal employees and citizens to receive the discounted price of 50 cents to a location or $1 for round trip, they must present their work identification badges or Certified Degree of Indian Blood or tribal citizenship cards upon pick-up. --- The tribe works with three transit systems within its jurisdiction, all with fixed routes. --- KATS has five fixed routes: Stilwell to West Siloam Springs, Tahlequah to Claremore, Tahlequah to Catoosa, Sallisaw to Tahlequah and Stillwell to Tahlequah. --- The Pelivan Transit System, which operates in the northern part of the tribe’s jurisdiction, has four fixed routes: Pryor to Catoosa, Salina to Tahlequah, Jay to Tahlequah and Tahlequah to Catoosa routes. --- The Muskogee County Transit works with the tribe for just a Muskogee-to-Tahlequah route. --- There is also a demand-response category, which is available for Native Americans needing rides to health care facilities, governmental facilities, jobs, grocery shopping and other locations of this nature. For tribal citizens to receive the discounted price of 50 cents to a location or $1 for round trip, they must present their Certified Degree of Indian Blood or tribal citizenship cards upon pick-up. They must also provide a minimum of 72 hours advanced notice, if available. --- “They can haul folks from their homes basically to wherever they need to go,” Lynn said. “We do not fund rides that take them to casinos or things of that nature.” --- Lynn said the transit program is to help people save money by providing rides so that they don’t have to spend money driving their vehicles. He said in fiscal year 2013 the program provided nearly 55,000 rides. --- “If every time they can ride the bus and save a dollar or two for fuel and wear and tear on their vehicle we feel it puts dollars back into their pocket and gives them a more disposable income,” he said. --- CN Transit Clerk Lois Leach is an employee who uses the transit program. She said while using the service she saved money from not having to commute to Tahlequah from Salina. --- “I think a lot of them it helps their full mileage. For me, it would be wear and tear on a car because I live on a country road,” she said. “I think that’s a big plus to be able to have another alternative if anything happened to your car, then you know you’ll be able to get to work still.” --- Cherokee Nation Transit began in 2008 working with just KATS and only provided one fixed route. Since then, it has expanded to 10 fixed routes and now works with KATS, Pelivan Transit System, Muskogee County Transit and Cimarron Public Transit. --- The Stilwell-to-West Siloam Springs route has a pick-up time from Stilwell at 7 a.m. Its pick-up time from West Siloam Springs is 3 p.m. on Tuesday through Saturday. --- For more information, visit ---  transit.cherokee.org .

PARK HILL, Okla. – Since the opening of the Ancient Village in 1967, working at the Cherokee Heritage Center has been a tradition for Rex Smith and his family. --- Rex, who works maintenance and grounds keeping at the CHC, started working in the recently razed Ancient Village with his mother, Betty Smith, in 1967. From 1970 to 1985 he worked with the Trail of Tears drama and, after some time away, came back in 2000 to work his current position. --- “I just, overall, have fun out here. Still enjoy it,” he said. “This is where I started at and hopefully this is where I end my career as a worker. Unless something goes wrong, this is where I want to be for the next 10 years.” --- Rex said that in the past there have been six sisters and four brothers in his family who worked at the CHC. “I’ve had a good relationship with my family and my kids,” he said. --- According to a June 2013 Cherokee Phoenix article, work began on the CHC on Feb. 23, 1966 and the Ancient Village opened in 1967. The amphitheater, which hosted the Trail of Tears drama, opened in 1969. Construction of the CHC’s museum, which was designed to resemble a Cherokee longhouse from the old Cherokee country in the southeast, began in 1973 and it opened a year later. --- In 1985, the museum was remodeled and more technology was used for its exhibits, and in 2001, in cooperation with the National Park Service, a permanent Trail of Tears exhibit was installed in the museum that utilizes artifacts and statues to tell the story behind the forced removal of Cherokee people from their southeastern homes in the late 1830s. --- “This is one of the places I started at and I knew I could do this, this is fun, exciting and I love to do what I get to do out here,” Rex said. --- Today, he works with his daughter, Feather Smith-Trevino, who works as a villager in the new Diligwa village. His grandson, Calvin, also occasionally works in the village, and his son, Justin, used to work at the CHC but now works at the John Ross Museum. --- “It’s kind of the family business,” Feather said. “My grandmother was one of the first villagers out in the Ancient Village in 1967, so my dad grew up out here, and then I came out here when I was volunteering in 2001. I worked with the drama for five years before I actually started here in 2006.” --- Smith-Trevino, who works in the Diligwa village, said working with her family has been fun and has helped her learned a lot about her Cherokee culture. --- “It’s a lot of fun. It’s been really rewarding to be out here all these years,” she said. “I’ve learned a lot about my culture during that time, but it’s also nice to get to educate people. The culture, it really defines who I am, who we are. It’s one of those things that when I was younger I didn’t realize exactly how important it was to me, but as I grew up I kind of got to realizing that everything about me revolves around the Cherokee Nation, and it really helps to define who I am. It’s been rewarding and has led me to what it is that I want to do and has helped me figure out what I want to be in life.”

EUCHA, Okla. – The multitude of green stems poking out of beds of leaves are easily distinguishable from the surrounding landscape. The patches of wild onions on Tad Dunham’s land near Eucha are something he looks forward to every spring. --- Using a shovel, he slices into the damp bottomland to unearth a bundle of onions. Dunham, a Cherokee Nation citizen, pulls the stalks of onions from the loose dirt, shakes off the excess dirt and places the onions in a plastic bucket. He then carefully places the dirt he pushed up with his shovel back into ground to keep from disturbing the land too much and to ensure the onion patch will provide a crop next spring. --- “These are what I call wooded onions, and they usually pop out of the ground the first of March. The river onions, they start getting them the first of February,” he said. “These are a little bit short right now, but give them a couple of weeks and they’ll be bigger onions. They sure have a good flavor though.” --- He said, like most people in the area, he eats the onions with eggs. He also seasons brown beans and fried potatoes with wild onions. --- “Actually, anything you can use onions for you can use these wild onions, and I think they just do a better job,” he said. --- Growing up near Strang, Dunham said he used to pick wild onions with his Cherokee mother. --- “She probably knew all the onion patches in a 50-mile radius, and every spring she would have us out there digging wild onions, and we had a lot of fun doing that, running around in the woods digging onions. And then when we got back to the house, she wouldn’t let anybody help her clean them, and that was the hard part,” Dunham said. --- After picking the onions he wants, Dunham takes them to a nearby stream and washes off the dirt. He then takes the onions to his house where he washes them again in a sink, places them in a bowl, gets a cutting board and knife and then cuts the roots off the onion stalks. --- He then chops up the onions in one-inch pieces and places the pieces in boiling water for five to 10 minutes to soften them. The onions are then placed in cooking oil for about two minutes before they are used to season other foods or cooked with eggs. --- “I grew up on bacon grease and lard. Nowadays, we try to be a little more healthful, so now we use olive oil or canola oil,” he said. --- When cooking the onions with eggs, he and his wife Linda beat about a dozen eggs in a bowl before mixing them with a half-pound or three-quarter pound of onions. The eggs and onions are constantly stirred in the skillet for about 15 minutes until completely cooked. --- On this day, Linda warms up ham and bakes biscuits to serve with the onions. --- Tad said he appreciates having a heritage of living off the land. He has fruit trees near his house and grows potatoes. He picks black walnuts, wild mushrooms and black haws, which are a dark-black berry fruit that grows on his land. Also, his grandchildren hunt deer on his land, and the family has a pond for fishing. --- “We can pretty well sustain ourselves, weather permitting, off of this property,” he said. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – As part of its outreach program, the Encore! Performing Society recently performed “Peter and the Wolf” in the Cherokee and English languages for Cherokee Nation Immersion Charter School students. --- “(The) immersion (school) is, for this year, our final stop in our outreach program. And the reason we want to do it in Cherokee is because our communities have the majority population of Cherokee, and we are lucky enough to have a second language in a school that conducts training in second language,” Lena Gladkova-Huffman, Encore! Performing Society director, said. --- Encore! Performing Society is part of the Academy of Performing Arts, a Tahlequah dance studio. Gladkova-Huffman, its director, is originally from Russia where she studied dance. --- “Encore! Performing Society is a young organization,” she said. “We’ve only been around for two years and for the two years we’ve been bringing different ballet and dance productions to the communities of northeastern Oklahoma.” --- The APA provides instruction in Russian ballet, international ballroom, tap, musical theater, contemporary and Irish dance. It also offers recreational classes and almost half of its students are CN citizens. --- “I, myself, am from Russia and I am a second language speaker all the time, so I love to not only support the artistic point and the aspect of this very educational program but the second language of it as well,” Gladkova-Huffman said. --- The story “Peter and the Wolf” is about a young man who lives at his grandfather’s home. One day, Peter goes into the meadow, which presents the cat, bird and duck. After leaving the garden gate open, Peter’s grandfather scolds him for being in the meadow where a wolf could appear. --- After his grandfather takes him back into the house and locks the gate a wolf appears and chases the animals eventually catching the duck. --- Peter fetches a rope and climbs over the garden wall into the tree, and with the help of the bird, is able to tie up the wolf. Some hunters, who have been tracking the wolf, come out of the forest ready to shoot, but Peter gets them to help him take the wolf to a zoo instead. --- Performers consisted of CN citizens Bretly Crawford, who played Peter; Sydney Terry, who played the bird; Clistia Geary, who played the duck and a hunter; Hadley Hume, who played the cat; Sinihele Rhoades, who played the grandfather; and Conlie Smith and Noelia Lopez who played hunters. --- Erin Wilcox played the wolf and Gracie Davenport also played the duck. --- “Our dance director and choreographer choses who gets what part,” Hume, who has been dancing for almost eight years, said. “She just chose by how the dancers danced and got into character.” --- Hume, 13, added that to help her for her role, she watched a cat that lives around her house. --- Before the dancers performed in English, the story was told to the immersion students in Cherokee. The students also got the chance to say what each character was in Cherokee. --- “All of those characters, our students are all familiar with those words because those are in our vocabulary terms that we learn at our immersion school,” Helena McCoy, immersion school teacher, said. --- Immersion school staff members helped translate the production into Cherokee after CN citizen Teri Rhoades asked to have it translated. --- Teri is Sinihele’s mother. Sinihele has been dancing since she was 4 and is the current Little Miss Cherokee Ambassador. She also attends the immersion school. --- “This one, to us, is the most special because Sini goes to the immersion school and she’s dancing here for her friends and they get to see her dance,” Teri said. “Because I came up with the idea of bringing it to the immersion school, we were kind of worried about it because it was in English, so I asked to have ‘Peter and the Wolf’ translated and the principal, Holly Davis, and Tony Workman (academic counselor) worked with Lena, over at the dance school, to have it done so that it could be read in Cherokee whereas before in was in English. That way the immersion kids could relate to it both ways and relate to the Cherokee language being applied to the arts.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C., hosted “Cherokee Days” on April 3-5 to share the true Cherokee story with the public. --- For the first time in intertribal history, the Cherokee Nation, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians worked together to share the Cherokee story with an exhibit showcasing a timeline of historical milestones, live cultural art demonstrations and cultural performances. --- Along with cultural presentations, Cherokee scholars shared information about the Cherokee language and history and interacted with museum visitors to share accurate information about the tribes. Children also were able to make and take clay medallions and cornhusk dolls. --- Carolyn McClellan, a Cherokee Nation citizen and NMAI Community and Constituent Services assistant director, was the festival’s logistics manager. She said she expected a “tremendous response” from the public because while volunteering at the museum’s welcome desk on a weekly basis, she’s asked questions about the Cherokee people and what information and artifacts about the Cherokee the museum has. --- “I’m so excited to have all three federally recognized Cherokee tribes here for a three-day festival at the museum. It’s monumental. I just never dreamt it possible that everybody would come at one time. Nothing like this has ever happened at the museum,” she said. --- McClellan said she’s worked on having a Cherokee event at the museum for about two years. The museum offers space to tribes that want to showcase their cultures and histories. She approached the CN’s Cultural Tourism Office approximately two years ago about having a Cherokee-themed event at the NMAI and then reached out to EBCI representatives. --- She said the main purpose was to share an accurate picture of Cherokee life ways, culture and history. --- “It’s to educate the public that Cherokee people are alive and well, that we’ve maintained our language, that we have a vibrant history and we have a wonderful culture that we want to share,” she said. “We want to let them know there are opportunities to come to Cherokee country whether it be in North Carolina or Oklahoma and promote cultural tourism for the tribes for individuals here that have an interest in continuing relationships that they’ll be starting over the course of these next three days.” --- Cherokee National Treasure Shawna Cain said the event was a wonderful experience. She demonstrated basket making and met visitors from Germany, Sweden, Russia, Japan, Ukraine and the United States. --- “So many visitors were unaware that we have three federally recognized Cherokee nations,” she said. “This was such a bonding experience as Cherokee people, reminding us we are really one people who share a rich history and culture. Overall, we were pleasantly exhausted by the first day’s end from the many visitors who came to see and learn about Cherokees and their culture.” --- Cain said the experience allowed artists from all three nations to sit together and share stories, techniques and fellowship, which does not occur often enough. --- It was important to her, she said, to convey to those visiting “Cherokee Days” that Cherokee people have “a rich history of survival, perseverance and success,” not only historically, but also as contemporary Cherokees living in the 21st century. --- “I hoped people walked away understanding that we do often dress in time-period clothing to teach about our past and embrace the present. However, just because we aren’t wearing feathers, beads, moccasins and such when we are walking down the street, we are still Cherokees. As Cherokees we walk in two worlds, are very much alive and well and proud of our people and history,” Cain said. --- Another Cherokee National Treasure attending the event, Tommy Wildcat, said he was honored to promote his Cherokee heritage to people from around the world. --- “I’m here as a Cherokee Nation representative, one of seven National Treasures, to represent our heritage and culture,” he said. “I’m recognized for river cane flute making, and I’m here with a river cane flutes and performing (playing his flute). I’ve always done my best to promote the beauty of the Cherokee heritage and inform the public.” --- He said many people he met at the museum claimed Indian heritage and were interested in the Cherokee language and traditions. --- “The interest is strong with many people even if they are not citizens of our tribe. They try and want to keep connected, so it’s great that the National Museum of American Indians is hosting ‘Cherokee Days,’” he said. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

BY BRITTNEY PARKER --- Macon News --- FRANKLIN, N.C. – The debate regarding the Nikwasi Indian Mound located in Franklin may soon see a resolution. --- On March 3, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Principal Chief Michell Hicks spoke to the Franklin Town Aldermen in hopes of beginning talks regarding the preservation of the historic landmark. --- “I have a simple request … obviously the Eastern Band feels, for many reasons, that the mound should be back in the name of the Eastern Band,” said Hicks. “I understand that may not be a simple task as it relates to the history of the mound and the responsibility of the town. One of the things that is important to us as a tribe is to make sure that we are at least part of the process of protecting these lands, these areas that are so rich from a spiritual and cultural perspective. I feel a true responsibility as a tribal leader. As requested by many of our tribal leaders, we want to do our best to do the right thing.” --- Hicks cited the successful partnership that the EBCI has had with Macon County in the past regarding projects such as the Cowee School project and the Little Tennessee Watershed programs. He told the town that he hoped a similar partnership could be formed with Franklin to ensure the best interest of the Nikwasi Mound for all parties involved. --- While Franklin and the EBCI have struggled over the town’s treatment of the mound since a pesticide was used on the landmark, killing the grass, Hicks assured the board that that issue was not his reason for attending Monday night’s meeting. --- “I feel in my heart that we have a responsibility as a tribe to make this request,” said Hicks. --- “It was a productive meeting. Chief Hicks was most gracious and I felt that after the meeting the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Franklin recognized that we each have a strong kinship to the mound,” said Franklin Mayor Bob Scott. “I came away from the meeting with the feeling that we will work this out mutually. I think everyone will benefit from a partnership if that is the way we decide to go. Both the town and the tribe have benefits for each other in this venture. Working together we will ensure that the mound remains protected for generations to come and that is the most important thing.” --- While the tribe requested that ownership be returned to the EBCI, Hicks informed the town that if that were not possible, he would like to begin talks regarding a preservation agreement to ensure that all parties remain good stewards to the land. --- Two other tribal members also spoke to the town board, urging the town to consider the cultural and spiritual significance the land has to the Cherokee Indians. --- “It is childish to go back and forth about the ownership of the last,” said EBCI citizen Matthew Tooni. “In my opinion, I would like to see the mound returned to Cherokee hands, but I understand that may not be possible… I want to see the land preserved. What is to keep future generations who do not understand the importance and cultural significance, from bulldozing it? I don’t want to see that happen.” --- Cherokee Nation citizen Tom Belt, who works at Western Carolina University in the Cherokee Language Program, pleaded with the board to consider the tribe’s “intrinsic spiritual and cultural value” in land that once housed his ancestors. --- “Those vales are more than just something you can pass down, they mean so much more than that,” he said. --- The board showed unanimous consent to arrange further discussion with Chief Hicks regarding a resolution that best suits both Franklin and the EBCI. ---  – REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION

CHEROKEE, N.C. – Six Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians citizens will cycle the 950-mile route of the Trail of Tears this summer. --- Their preparation includes not only physical training and planning but also learning about the history of the forced removal. --- This year’s bicycle riders are Russell Bigmeat, Ty Bushyhead, Boyd, Kelsey, Standingdeer Owle, Katie Sneed, Richie Sneed and Pat Watkins. Tara McCoy is coordinating the preparation, and the riders are being sponsored by the EBCI. They will ride an average of 50 miles per day on the three-week trip in June. --- The cyclists just completed three history workshops at the Museum of the Cherokee Indian. The museum is an interpretive site on the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. --- The first workshop described the history and cultural background of the Cherokees leading to the removal. The workshop emphasized the efforts of the Cherokee Nation to stay, including the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper and its anti-removal editorials; speaking tours by young educated Cherokee men throughout the northeast; lobbyists and petitions in the U.S. Congress; and taking their case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that the Cherokees were a sovereign nation in 1832, the basis for sovereignty today. --- The second workshop looked at the routes of removal and at the specific locations the riders will be traveling through. --- The third workshop examined the history of the EBCI specifically at the time of forced removal in 1838 and how people struggled and succeeded in their efforts to remain on their ancestral homeland. A petition from the citizens of Aquohee, the district that included the Cherokee area at the time of removal, said: “The bones of our fathers lie here in security, and we cannot consent to abandon them to be crushed beneath the feet of strangers.” --- The cyclists participated in the workshops on Saturday mornings before beginning their training rides. --- Barbara R. Duncan, education director at the Museum of the Cherokee Indian, taught the workshops. Duncan and the museum have provided these workshops for the Trail of Tears riders for several years.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation recently selected 13 Cherokee students to venture on the 2014 Remember the Removal bike ride. Each summer a selected group of Cherokee students ride the northern route of the Trail of Tears that their Cherokee ancestors were once forced to walk along. --- “I’ve wanted to do this ride for years,” Cassie Moore, a 24-year-old student at Northeastern State University, said. “I am very excited to be selected and ready to accept the challenge that will come with it. I’m not only excited to meet new people, but help my fellow riders endure this journey that our ancestors overcame.” --- The bike ride begins in late May in New Echota, Ga. It follows the northern route of the Trail of Tears and ends in Oklahoma. It is a 950-mile ride and goes through Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. --- Riders will travel for three weeks at an average of 50 to 60 miles per day. There were nearly 16,000 Cherokees forced on the voyage to Indian Territory with nearly 4,000 of them dying due to starvation, exposure and disease. --- Riders visit historic landmarks and various gravesites along the Trail. They visit Blythe Ferry in Tennessee, the last piece of Cherokee homeland ancestors stood upon before beginning the walk to Indian Territory. They also visit Mantle Rock in Kentucky, which provided shelter to the ancestors while they waited for the Ohio River to thaw so they could cross and continue on. --- The students selected for the 2014 ride are: Jacob Chavez, 16, of Tahlequah; Kassidy “Tye” Carnes, 16, of Tahlequah; Elizabeth Burns, 17, of Claremore; Chance Rudolph, 17, of Claremore; Madison Taylor, 17, of Claremore; Jamekah Rios, 17, of Stilwell; Zane Scullawi, 18, of Collinsville; Carly Copeland, 18, of Eucha; Jordan McLaren, 18, of Tahlequah; Keeley Godwin, 21, of Welling; Adriana Collins, 21, of Claremore; Charli Barnoskie, 24, of Tahlequah; and Moore, of Tahlequah.

CATOOSA, Okla. – On Feb. 21, 17 Cherokee Nation translators celebrated with Microsoft officials at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa on the groundbreaking progress being made by translators in the Cherokee Language Program. --- The event coincided with International Mother Language Day, a United Nations event to honor the more than 6,000 diverse languages worldwide. --- “When we first started out in translation, I never dreamed we would come this far with so many projects and products now offering the Cherokee language, so this is amazing,” translator Durbin Feeling said. “As more people learn about us, there seems to always be new translation projects to work on.” --- The CN is among the first tribes to start a formal translation department using its fluent speakers. In January, translators translated 150,000 modern English terms into Cherokee for Microsoft’s Office Online. For the first time, it allows users to create Word, PowerPoint and Excel documents in the Cherokee syllabary. --- Microsoft’s Senior International Project engineer Alfred Hellstern, Native American Accounts Manager Don Lionetti and engineer Tracy Monteith, an Eastern Band of Cherokees citizen, gave the translators a plaque on behalf of the technology company. --- “Microsoft put efforts into this, but the bulk of the heavy lifting was by translators at the Cherokee Nation,” Lionetti said. “You’re in a very elite group since there is no other tribal nation that has their language in the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office products, which is a testament to the translators’ passion and dedication to be able to do this.” --- The CN has worked with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yale University and the Gilcrease Museum on translation projects. --- “The Cherokee language is one of the most important aspects of who we are as a tribe, and many elements of our culture are contained in our language,” Roy Boney, Cherokee Language Program manager said. “Our language offers more than communication. It transmits cultural knowledge and a mode of thinking that is uniquely Cherokee. To lose our language would mean a huge loss of part of our heritage, and the goal of the Cherokee Nation Language Program is to ensure our language lives on for future generations.”

BY AMBLE SMOKER --- Cherokee One Feather --- MURPHY, N.C. – Few instances can replicate the emotional power of athletic sporting events and the proud traditions of the Cherokee culture. --- However, with the recent Smoky Mountain Conference tournament victory, the Cherokee Middle School boys basketball team proved to do just that when they defeated the Swain County Maroon Devils 40-30 on Feb. 6 at Murphy High School. --- The Braves capped off a phenomenal year where they not only captured the SMC tournament championship, but did so in a manner that honors their cultural heritage while promoting the continuation of the Cherokee language. --- CMS boys basketball coach Micah Swimmer has introduced the Cherokee language into his team’s game plan as a way to teach and perpetuate the language. Utilizing the Cherokee language, the young men learn vital words, phrases and numbers to assist with their learning development while also gaining a competitive advantage on the court. --- “In high school, I remember playing against Choctaw Central and it amazed me to hear them speak their native language on the basketball court and football field,” Swimmer said. “My sophomore year, we were playing at home and the whole first half they were telling each other all kinds of stuff in their language, and we had no idea what they were saying. --- “At halftime, my friend had an idea to say the Pledge of Allegiance. He said, ‘I will bring the ball up and I will yell a-tu-is-do-di (to promise) and you yell back tsi-tu-is-di (I promise) and cut to the basket.’ We felt proud because we were using our language and they didn’t know what we were saying,” he added. “After that night, I made it a goal of mine to learn our language and coach for the Braves while trying to preserve our language through sports. It has proved to be an advantage for my teams and instilled a sense of pride.” --- Swimmer took those same concepts and incorporated them into his coaching style as all the plays and calls are in Cherokee. At a recent semifinals game, one of the players missed an open man and Swimmer yelled, “U-yv-sdi. U-tse-sdi wi-vi-si,” which translates to “Bitter. Give it to Opossum.” Both players understood the call and reacted accordingly. --- When asked to elaborate on the importance of each player having a Cherokee name, Swimmer said each player has a Cherokee name they acquired when they came through my Cherokee language classes at Cherokee Central Schools. --- “Most players chose their own names while some who had traditional last names, such as Walkingstick or Pheasant, usually took their own last name. Everyone knows who my boys are by their English names, but very few know who they are by their Cherokee names,” he said. --- The Braves finished the season with a 15-2 record while clinching the SMC tournament title.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Late former Principal Chief Wilma P. Mankiller ranks No. 48, between Oprah Winfrey at No. 47 and Meryl Streep at No. 49, in Glamour magazine’s “The 75 Most Important Women of the Past 75 Years” list. --- She is on the list among women such as first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, activist Rosa Parks and author and activist Gloria Steinem. According to the magazine’s description, Mankiller’s placement was justified because “in 1985 she became the first woman to lead a major Native American tribe – and doubled employment while in office.” --- Mankiller served the Cherokee Nation as deputy chief starting in 1983, serving alongside Principal Chief Ross Swimmer. In 1985, Swimmer resigned from the position, which opened the gate for Mankiller to take the reins. --- She became the first female principal chief of the CN and was elected in her own campaign in 1987. She was re-elected in 1991. Mankiller served the Cherokee people for three terms and decided to not run in 1995 because of health problems. --- Mankiller died on April 6, 2010, at her home in rural Adair County from pancreatic cancer. --- She won several awards, including the John W. Gardner Leadership award and Ms. Magazine’s Women of the Year in 1987. She was also inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. --- She wrote her first book MANKILLER: A Chief and Her People, an autobiography that ranked on the national bestseller list. She went on to co-author EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY: Reflections by Contemporary Indigenous Women. --- In 2013, the feature film THE CHEROKEE WORD FOR WATER was released. It tells the story of the Bell waterline project that Mankiller and Charlie Soap worked on, which helped launch her political career and began the friendship with Soap that ended in marriage. --- To view Glamour magazines “The 75 Most Important Women of the Past 75 Years” list visit, ---  www.glamour.com .

CHEROKEE, N.C. – Gilliam Jackson is physically and mentally preparing to begin a nearly 2,200-mile journey along the Appalachian Trail, which begins in Georgia and ends in Maine. --- The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians citizen has already hiked approximately 325 miles of the trail in North Carolina, his home state. --- “Because I have done many sections of this area many different times, I plan to skip this section,” he said. “I have also completed approximately 100 miles of the 240 miles in Pennsylvania, and I will skip that part also.” --- Jackson said he completed much of the Pennsylvania section in the winter because of the rocks and its scarcity of water. --- “Winter hiking presented a different challenge. The rocks were icy and very difficult and dangerous, but no snakes,” he said. --- Around March 15 he plans to leave from Springer Mountain, Ga., and enter Tennessee five days later. From Tennessee he wants to hike northeast through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and finally to Maine where the trail ends at Mount Katahdin. --- It’s estimated 2,300 hikers begin the 2,180-mile journey in Georgia every spring, with only 500 to 600 hikers finishing the journey in Maine. --- “Once I start, I plan to finish within 100 days, although I plan to get off the trail on occasions to reload provisions and rest,” Jackson said. “I have many friends along the way who have committed to pick me up off the trail and provide a bed, food and showers. There will be days when I will be off the trail for a couple of days. I really do not have a cutoff day when I want to be finished. I just know I want to enjoy being on the trail.” --- He said hiking friends who have completed the Appalachian Trail and stories he has read about the trail inspired him to tackle the feat. He added that he’s been consulting with hikers who have years of hiking experience and have completed the trail. --- “I truly enjoy being in the woods and that is my greatest motivator,” Jackson said. “I have been hiking all my life, and physically, I think I am in good condition. Most...hikers say its more a mental challenge to be self-sustaining for that many miles and that length of time.” --- He said he’s bought the most-up-to-date hiking equipment available and plans to keep his pack as light as possible at 35 to 38 pounds, which includes his tent, stove, food, water, backpack, sleeping bag and other essentials. --- “I have hiked and been in the woods all my life, and it’s been great therapy for me. I don’t ever remember not being in the woods, and I truly enjoy being surrounded and in the midst of God’s beautiful creations. And I enjoy meeting and talking to other hikers,” Jackson said. “In the last few years I have concentrated a whole lot on the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park has over 800 miles (of trails), and I have hiked most of those trails. The trails are also some of the most challenging in this country.” --- He said he understands the challenges he’ll face along the Appalachian Trail such as elevations ranging from 1,750 feet to 6,650 feet in North Carolina. He added that hikers know Pennsylvania as Rocksvannia because of the many rocks, “big ones, little ones, sharp ones, flat ones.” --- In New Hampshire, the White Mountains pose a different challenge. Mount Washington has the highest recorded wind speed on Earth and subject to snow year round. --- “I was hiking the Whites back in early August of 2012, and I had to wear a heavy three season jacket. There are many challenges, but there are also many incredible gorgeous views, and the people I have met on the trail are outstanding,” Jackson said. --- He said the biggest challenge he’ll face is being away from his two grandchildren and two children. --- “I spend a lot of time with them daily, and I know they will be cheering me on. We will be missing each other at the same time.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – An open house was held Feb. 1 at the Cherokee Veterans Center to allow Cherokee veterans to donate items they wish to display in the center when it opens later this year. --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker, Deputy Principal Chief S. Joe Crittenden and Tribal Councilors Curtis Snell and Lee Keener attended the event to greet and visit with veterans as they delivered their items, which included uniforms, photographs, flags, medals and other small mementos. --- Baker said the items donated not only memorialize the veterans’ service to the United States but also memorialize their service to the Cherokee Nation. --- “We’ve had people coming that are extremely proud of their service,” he said. --- There are numerous display cases to fill in the center. In one case, Tim Baker’s service in the Navy during World War II is honored with related, donated items. Tim Baker is the late father of Chief Baker. --- “This is an opportunity to display items at the Cherokee Nation where generations will be able to come back and see the medals, see the honors and see the write ups of their family,” Chief Baker said. --- He added that more items from veterans are needed to fill the display cases inside the 8,700-square-foot center. Along with displays and Cherokee artwork, the center has space for veteran’s services, counseling offices, a kitchen area, a library and a community room. --- Mary Adair HorseChief of Sequoyah County brought a booklet she made to honor her brother John Adair. --- The CN citizen served as an aviator in the Navy during the Vietnam War and piloted more than 200 missions over North Vietnam flying an A-6 Intruder. Within the booklet, she also honors other family members who served in the military. --- “I have memoirs from my brother from his service days. I just typed them up and put them in here. He’s my little brother. He served in Vietnam, and he had three tours of duty over there. He flew off of an aircraft carrier, and I feel very fortunate he made it back. He had some close calls,” she said. “There’s also some pictures of relatives I thought might be of interest to somebody.” --- HorseChief’s family has a long history of serving America, including a grandfather who served in the War of 1812. --- “He and one of his brothers were in the Battle of New Orleans and his brother didn’t make it back. Somewhere I have a copy of his (grandfather) service record,” she said. --- Another grandfather served during the Civil War under the leadership of Cherokee Gen. Stand Watie. Her father served during World War I and was exposed to mustard gas, which left him disabled for the remainder of his life. --- “I’m kind of a peace dove. I don’t care too much for wars,” she said. --- CN citizen Jimmy Langley of McAlester brought mementos to display, including a replica of a Cherokee Braves flag he took with him to Iraq. --- “Before I deployed in 2003, I had some friends from the Cherokee Nation that gave me a Cherokee Braves flag,” he said. “I brought that flag in because it belongs to all the Cherokee people. It flew all over Iraq from 2003 through 2010. People got to know when they saw that flag that was where they could resupply their ammo because I was an ammo supply officer.” --- He served with the 3rd Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Division and the 101st Airborne Division while in Iraq as an ammunition supply and explosive safety officer. --- Langley said his Cherokee great-great grandfather Lock Langley fought under the Cherokee Braves flag with the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles cavalry during the Civil War. This unit was also under Gen. Watie. --- “Like I said, the flag was given to me by some friends of mine who knew the history. It was something to take (to Iraq) that had a connection to me and also had a connection to my Cherokee heritage,” Langley said. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

VINITA, Okla. – The winter season is the busiest time of year for Cherokee Nation pediatricians because of peaking numbers of cold and flu cases, as well as aggravated asthma and allergies. --- CN citizen and Vinita Health Center pediatrician Nicole Willis, 31, of Claremore, has seen a rise in visits firsthand. --- “I have seen really sick children as a result of the flu and respiratory syncytial virus,” Willis said. “As a pediatrician, I always encourage parents to take preventative measures with their children. Parents should get their children the influenza vaccine and practice frequent hand washing, as well as avoid busy places during the flu season.” --- Willis, a recipient of the Oklahoma Osteopathic Association Rookie Physician of the Year Award, is the most recent addition to pediatricians working for the tribe. She wanted to work in a rural area, and a scholarship from Indian Health Service encouraged her to give back to her American Indian community. --- Willis finished her residency with Oklahoma State University Medical Center and The Children’s Hospital at Saint Francis in Tulsa in 2012 before working for the Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma in its Norman clinic. She helped reach a near-capacity patient load after only three months. --- In March, she started at the Vinita Health Center and now sees patients from as far as Joplin, Mo., and Springfield, Mo. --- “Most of my patients are local and from the Joplin area, where they want a pediatrician closer to home,” Willis said. “I have a great patient population. They’re the best part of the job and remind me on a daily basis why I do what I do.” --- Vinita resident and CN citizen Amy Turner had been taking her 4-year-old daughter to a private pediatrician in Claremore, but switched recently to Willis at the Vinita Health Center. --- “It’s just so much more convenient with work and the drive to be able to bring her to a doctor here in town,” Turner said. “It helps that Dr. Willis is so great. We really love her.” --- Other CN health facilities that have one or more pediatricians are W.W. Hastings Hospital in Tahlequah, Three Rivers Health Center in Muskogee, Redbird Smith Health Center in Sallisaw, Amo Health Center in Salina, Wilma P. Mankiller Health Center in Stilwell and Sam Hider Health Center in Jay. --- For more information, call the Vinita Health Center at 918-256-4800.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Dr. Neil Morton, Cherokee Nation’s Education Services senior advisor, was recently named a Sequoyah Fellow by Northeastern State University. He is the second person to hold the title with the first being the late former Principal Chief Wilma Mankiller. --- Being a Sequoyah Fellow will allow him to serve as an advisor to Native American students and programs. --- “Sequoyah Fellow is an honorary appointment that provides some ideas, assistance, direction as the university attempts to improve and broaden the scope and therefore the service of some of its Native American students,” Morton said. --- Morton said he would continue working at the CN while holding an office for the unpaid Sequoyah Fellow position. --- “It’s so different from an actual position,” he said. “It’s trying to be a good listener and trying to see what might be available to help advance the cause of Native American students on campus as well as their effect on high school students who chose to enter higher education at Northeastern.” --- One goal Morton wants to accomplish as a Sequoyah Fellow is to speak with Native students and gather their expectations and hear what they feel is needed at NSU. --- “Too often I think (there is) not enough input from students on what students consider to be most critical and most needed at an immediate time or a particular time,” he said. --- Morton said there are several areas he plans to focus on such as counseling students to determine what happens to them after they exit NSU, what majors are they choosing and how appropriate those majors are for today’s and future job markets. --- Morton said he also wants to try to address the college dropout rate for Native Americans. --- “When you look at all the higher education stats, you’ll find Native Americans near the bottom quartile instead of the top quartile,” he said. “I think that with some emphasis on successful programs, with some emphasis on appropriate career awareness and appropriateness on encouragement, we can move from that bottom quartile to that top quartile.” --- Since 1957, Morton has worked in the education field as a former teacher, school superintendent and university professor. In 1970, he served as project director of the NSU Cherokee Bilingual Education Program. In 1976, he received a doctorate in education administration. In 1990, he served as director for the NSU Center for Tribal Studies, and since 2005 he has worked in CN Education Services. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

NORMAN, Okla. – The Gamma Delta Pi sorority at the University of Oklahoma will host a basketball tournament Feb. 22-23 to benefit the sorority’s diabetes philanthropy. --- This will be the 11th year the Native American sorority has hosted the tournament, which will begin at 9 a.m. on Feb. 22 at the Huston Huffman Fitness Center’s south courts at 1401 Asp Ave. on the OU campus. Gamma Delta Pi also hosts an annual Zumbathon for the cause. --- “Gamma Delta Pi works with two organizations primarily, 4 Healthy Kids and Project Power. We donate proceeds from the tournament to the two organizations. 4 Healthy Kids also has an annual track meet that we like to volunteer at,” Gamma Delta Pi Vice President Maddie Habeck said. --- The sorority raised $2,000 with its 2013 basketball tournament. --- Habeck said the sorority previously supported a Sudden Infant Death Syndrome organization. When that organization disbanded, she said the group began supporting diabetes prevention and awareness because of the disease’s growing prevalence in the Native community. --- The tournament will accept as many 10-man roster basketball teams as possible. The entry fee is $275 per team and a $150 deposit is required by Feb. 14 to ensure a spot in the tournament. There is a $25 late fee for deposits received after that date. The deposit should be mailed to P.O. Box 2493, Norman, OK, 73070. The team’s name, roster and contact person with phone number and address should be included. --- “We haven’t set a cap on the amount of teams, as that has not been a problem in the past,” Habeck said. --- Entry to watch the tournament is $5 for the entire day, $8 for the weekend and $3 for children. Children under 3 may enter for free. Raffle items and concessions will be available during the tournament. No outside food or drinks will be allowed. --- The sorority has also established a Facebook page for the tournament, which is titled “Gamma Delta Pi’s Annual Native Hoops Open Basketball Tournament.” For more information, call 918-698-1256. --- Gamma Delta Pi is the only Native American sorority at the University of Oklahoma.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Lisa Rutherford’s studio space in the Cherokee Arts Center is a testament to her artistic interests. Her pottery in the room mixes with her textile and beadwork. Also in the room are loose goose feathers that are to be part of capes she’s creating because she’s one of a handful of Cherokee artists who can make feathered capes and the only one currently doing so. --- Rutherford said pottery is her primary art form, learning from Cherokee National Treasure Jane Osti of Tahlequah. However, she also studied Southeastern-style beadwork with Cherokee National Treasure Martha Berry of Tyler, Texas. And somewhere along the way, some Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians friends sparked her interest in 18th-century Cherokee clothing, helping her create outfits from that period. --- She now demonstrates making traditional Cherokee arts at shows and other events dressed in 18th-century Cherokee clothing. But while researching Cherokee clothing and how tribal pottery was stamped with textiles she became interested in feather capes that were once worn by Cherokee people. --- “The Eastern Band had feather capes, and I wanted one too to go with my 18th-century clothing,” she said. “(Hernando) de Soto described these capes as early as 1540. He described different feather mantles and capes. Different explorers talked about the Cherokees wearing them as late as the 1700s. They were described as being on a net base with the brightest colored feathers from flamingos, parrots, turkeys, geese, ducks – the brighter colors were the preferred colors.” --- So far Rutherford has only used goose and turkey feathers for her capes but wants to try other feathers such as pheasant. She places lighter-colored feathers among darker feathers on her capes to create accents. --- Rutherford teamed up with Cherokee National Treasure Tonia Weavel of Tahlequah to learn how to make capes and mantles. Based on her research, Rutherford believes a mantle is longer and requires more feathers while a cape is shorter and mainly covers one’s shoulders. --- “We (she and Weavel) got together and decided if our ancestors could figure this out we can make one. So we borrowed a cape a museum professional had made in Pennsylvania and we studied the thread pattern. It was really hard. It took us six days to learn how to weave that. I finally wove one. I was able to make my first feather cape,” Rutherford said. --- Along with weaving the netting, finding good feathers is challenging, Rutherford said. And they can be expensive. A pound of dyed, sanitized goose feathers costs $80. After culling a pound of feathers, she said she might throw half of them away because they do not meet her standards. --- “It just takes a lot of time. You have to individually bend the quill on each feather and bend over a wire to make a nice round eye to sew through, and then you lash them down,” she said. “There are probably 750 to 800 feathers in a (over the shoulder) cape, so it takes a significant amount of time.” --- One of her hip-length mantles has approximately 2,200 feathers. --- She said the capes and mantles are warm and likely had practical use for Cherokee people to help keep them warm in cold weather. In her research she has found only Cherokee men wore the mantles. --- For a medium-length black cape on display in her studio she has won three second-place awards, a first-place award and three best of division awards at art shows. --- Rutherford said she she wants to branch out into painting, but only after filling her cape orders. --- “You have to do what sells when you’re a full-time artist even though you’d like to do something more fun. You have to budget your time and balance your priorities.” --- Since learning the craft in 2011, Rutherford has made 10 capes and has customer orders for five others. --- She said Oklahoma Cherokees are not interested in wearing capes with their traditional clothing because wearing 18th-century style clothing has not caught as it has with the Eastern Cherokees. --- “They’ve been very popular,” Rutherford said. “I’ve sold several to Eastern Band contestants for Miss Cherokee. I’ve sold some for exhibits.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – One mistake some people make at Thanksgiving is thinking of it as a day to overindulge and eat until they are miserable. But Tonya Swim, a Cherokee Nation W.W. Hastings Hospital dietician, said people wanting to stay on top of their caloric intakes should consider an “eating holiday” such as Thanksgiving as just another day. --- Through the hospital’s American Association of Diabetes Educators-accredited program, Swim and other dietitians help provide nutrition education to diabetic patients recently diagnosed, those fighting diabetes and those wanting to prevent the disease. --- She said some of her patients tend to ask for advice on eating better during holidays. --- “I talk to them more about not focusing on it as a holiday. It’s just another day, and we treat it just like any other day. You have to watch your portions. You have to be mindful about your eating,” Swim said. “Be mindful whenever you eat that. Savor the taste, you know, savor the smell of it. Don’t just push it down your mouth and eat it real fast because you don’t get to appreciate the food that you really like.” --- She said savoring foods makes it easier for people when they are about to eat that special meal or food. --- “Sometimes it may be pumpkin pie. Sometimes it may the green bean casserole. You never know what is somebody’s favorite. Not everybody likes the sweets at the holidays,” she said. --- Another tip for holiday eating is not keeping baked goods and unhealthy foods around the house. --- “A lot of times we bake a lot during the holidays because that is what we associate with the holidays,” Swim said. “Don’t make it unless you’re going somewhere, and then make it right before the party so you don’t have that temptation to kind of go and graze through what you’ve made.” --- Swim said a simple thing to do when cooking during the holidays is to change ingredients in the dishes. --- “Simple things would be to use the low sodium or the reduced sodium in your cooking – the skim milk or the low-fat 1-percent milk instead of using heavy cream, reduced fat cheese instead of the whole, what we call full-fat, the whole regular cheese,” she said. “That can knock sometimes 50 calories and up to seven grams of fat off of your recipes.” --- What it really boils down to, Swim said, is being mindful about the portions one is eating and not starving one’s self to eat or overindulge. --- “We can trick ourselves. ‘Oh it’s the party at work. I need to eat this cause it’ll make my mother-in-law mad.’ You know things like that,” she said. “We can trick ourselves very easily into ‘it’s OK for me to have it.’ And it is OK to have it, but we just have to remember it’s all about the portion size and it’s all about being mindful. Being aware of what you’re eating and how much you’re eating.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560 ---  Healthy Homemade Green Bean Casserole --- Casserole --- Cooking spray --- 4 Laughing Cow, LIGHT French Onion cheese wedges --- 1 tablespoon canola oil --- ½ onion, finely diced --- 1 teaspoon Smart Balance margarine --- 8 ounces sliced mushrooms, diced --- ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) --- ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper --- ½ cup fat-free, reduced-sodium chicken broth --- 2 teaspoons corn starch --- 2 teaspoons cold water --- ¼ cup 1% milk --- 2 14.5 cans no-salt added, cut green beans, drained --- Corn Flake Topping --- 1 cup corn flakes, crushed --- 1 2/3 tablespoons Smart Balance margarine, melted --- Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Col. Thomas Franklin, a doctor at Cherokee Nation’s W.W. Hastings Hospital, recently returned from Afghanistan, where he served three months as a flight surgeon for the U.S. Air Force Reserve as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. --- Franklin of Tulsa was a flight surgeon for the 459th Aeromedical Staging Squadron, a unit out of Joint Base Andrews, Md. The unit is responsible for refueling friendly aircrafts, and the flight surgeons treated military personnel. --- Because of higher altitudes and the decreased effects of gravity in flight, the risk of health issues is greater and requires special attention by trained medical staff. The unit was also part of a NATO coalition base, with Army, Navy, Marines, British and Australians. --- “A big part of what we do is participate in investigations when there’s an aircraft mishap. If there’s an aircraft that crashes, part of my job is to go out and take pictures and try to make some sort of medical assessment to figure out ways to keep things from reoccurring,” Franklin said. “These aircraft are extremely expensive, but the people who fly them are more important to us.” --- Franklin has worked for Hastings Hospital since completing his residency there in 2000. He currently serves as director of the emergency department. He started a four-year stint at Hastings to fulfill his scholarship from the National Health Service Corps, and after leaving for a few months, he returned because of his relationships with patients and co-workers. --- “To all of us who work with Dr. Franklin and for his patients that he cares for, he is known to be a conscientious provider of excellent emergency medical care,” Hastings CEO Brian Hail said. “That he also serves our nation in the U. S. Air Force is another example of his commitment to service, and it is a tremendous source of pride for all of us to have Dr. Franklin as part of our medical staff. We are glad he’s back safely and proud of his service to both the Air Force and the Cherokee Nation.” --- Franklin has been active duty in the military for 33 years and has received promotions and awards throughout his career, including the Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal and Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. --- “The support I’ve gotten from Hastings and Cherokee Nation for my military career has been phenomenal,” Franklin said. “Working for Hastings, I’ve been allowed to participate and serve the country without any detriment to my civilian job. I’ve been really amazed at the support I’ve gotten.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation’s Health Services offers free Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support trainings to CN citizens who are Health Services employees and charge $125 to others interested in taking the classes. --- ACLS classes train students to handle patients who suffer from cardiac arrest and stroke. Students train on human-like dummies before doing the real deal. The ACLS classes are monthly and usually start the first week each month. --- “The adults usually go down from cardiac arrest, the children don’t,” Mark Bighorse, EMS training supervisor, said. “It’s important to take the class (ACLS) to pretty much know what to do.” --- The minimum age for the class is 18, and it’s better if the person attending is a provider such as a doctor or nurse because of the course’s terminology. --- However, the course is open to anyone – CN citizen or non-citizen or health provider or non-provider. And CN Health Services employees can attend for free. --- Bighorse said eventually he would like to see all CN employees be able to attend for free. --- The PALS class trains students how to recognize and treat ill infants or children suffering from cardiopulmonary arrest. It teaches how to stabilize and transport them as well. PALS training is every other month and usually the third week. --- “That course (PALS) is designed for providers and it gives insight on pediatric emergencies and drug calculations, doses, rhythm disturbances everything that could cause a pediatric patient to go into cardiac arrest,” Bighorse said. --- To attend, individuals need to be at least a paramedic, nurse, doctor or some type of health provider. --- Trainers from the CN EMS conduct the two types of classes at the tribe’s EMS building located at 22116 S. Bald Hill Road in Tahlequah. --- Bighorse said the tribe offers the classes because it is important for people in the medical field to be up to date on their skills. The field is always changing, so the classes change with it. --- After students complete the courses, they receive a two-year certification through the American Heart Association. --- Each class usually has about 20 to 25 students and three instructors, per AHA standards. --- Bighorse, said students sometimes come back to help train after they have been in the field for a while. --- “Once they get their experience and they take an instructor course, they have to be a CPR instructor and CPR provider. Then they are eligible to do the instructor course. Then from there they are eligible to do the ACLS and PALS courses,” he said. “They usually just come by and want to stay up on their instructing skills.” --- For more information, email ---  mark-bighorse@cherokee.org . ---  stacie-guthrie@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000 ext. 5903

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Fifteen years after the Cherokee Nation received nearly 800 acres in Sequoyah County from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the tribe’s Natural Resources is making improvements on the land for a recreational area. --- “The Cherokee Nation was given some surplus land in Sequoyah County by the Corps of Engineers in 1998. It’s just a little under 800 acres, and it’s adjacent to the Arkansas River and the Kerr Lake reservoir,” CN Administration Liaison Pat Gwin said. --- The corps once used the land for a recreational area that consisted of picnic areas, boat ramps, fishing areas and camping sites maintained and operated by the state. The property has five recreational outlets on the lake and river. Four are no longer used, but Natural Resources maintains the fifth one. This site has camping areas, a boat ramp, picnic tables and fishing areas, which CN work crews are improving. --- “When the corps deemed the land surplus, the land came to us in 1998 with the stipulation (to) have one of those recreational areas for a time period of five years, which we did. Even after that agreement expired in 2003, to this date we’ve kept the recreational facility open,” Gwin said. --- That recreational area is called Sallisaw Creek Park. However, there are plans to rename it because it often gets confused with another Sallisaw Creek Park about five miles away, Natural Resources Manager G.V. Gulager said. --- The CN-operated park is located about four miles south of I-40 on Dwight Mission Road. --- “Currently, we have it open to the public and it’s free of charge. It’s something the Cherokee Nation is proud to have. We’re in the process of opening more of the park, doing more work here and creating more activity here,” Gulager said. --- He said the tribe wants to eventually bring in revenue from the park and other areas. Gulager said the tribe is paying for improvements while not collecting any fees from the public for using the park. --- “I think it’s going to come to that point, and it’s been expressed by the (Tribal) council and by the chief that we’re going to have to do something,” he said. --- Gulager said with more people learning of the park, it can become crowded, especially with boaters. That means the CN must provide more security, sanitation facilities, electricity and water for those crowds, which costs money, he said. --- “The Cherokee Nation can bear the brunt a little bit, but when it becomes a major issue for our finances we’re going to have to look for other resources, and the resources should come from the people that’s enjoying this park,” he said. --- Gulager added that with other recreational areas in Oklahoma being closed by budget constraints, more people are coming to Sallisaw Creek Park. And because it’s free, the site is attractive for people wishing to camp, fish and boat, he said. --- Park improvements include placing electricity at some campsites, improving roads and adding streetlights. Gulager said wells are on the property for water and more may be dug with the water quality monitored by the tribe’s environmental group. He said he wants to improve restroom facilities, and shelters would soon be placed over picnic tables. --- “That’s our main concern this winter and this spring, to get more water to various locations so that it will be adequate for everybody to camp,” he said. --- Another improvement is the addition of a walking and horse-riding trail, which gives people a chance to view the area’s beauty. Gulager said the trail has only been open about a month and already more than 240 horse riders have ridden it. --- “What we’re trying to do is make more recreation for everybody,” he said. “The natural setting makes it beautiful. It’s a wonderful part of the Cherokee Nation. In 14-county area, this is one the best looking places to come and enjoy.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – After years of not having one, Sequoyah High School’s marching band has entered its fifth year with more than 40 students on its roster. --- “I started five years ago, up to that point there was not an active band,” Sam Morris, SHS band director, said. “There were instruments on campus, so I saw an opportunity here and I thought I’d take advantage of it.” --- Before becoming Sequoyah’s band director, Morris directed Stilwell High School’s band for 36 years. --- When the SHS band reformed, there were seven high school and middle school students playing woodwind, brass and percussion instruments. Today, the band consists of clarinets, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones, baritones, tuba and percussion played by 41 high school and middle school students. --- “It’s gotten bigger. It’s gotten better. I think it’s awesome,” senior Jerilyn Willie said. “I like how we’re able to learn faster. It’s one of the advantages I think we have because we’re so small and we have to get things really quick because the way the school is we’re not able to all come after school or during summer like most high schools do.” --- Willie, who joined the band as a freshman, plays the flute. --- “I joined the band because I’ve always liked being able to play music and I’ve always heard about it making you smarter. I haven’t seen it yet, but I just like being able to make something,” she said. --- She said she plans to continue playing in college. --- “I plan on playing in college band and then going into musical therapy,” she said. “That’s the study of using music and beats and colorful props like bubbles and scarves and teach children just how to develop and it makes them freely be able to express themselves.” --- Although not part of the marching band, Morris also teaches music to 12 fifth and sixth graders from the Cherokee Nation Immersion School. --- “The fifth and sixth grade, they’re basically my beginners,” he said. “They’re from the immersion school and they’re just learning how to play.” --- The band performs during Sequoyah football and basketball games, pep rallies, parades and marching competitions. Next semester the band will start participating in concert competitions. --- “My favorite part would be the football games and the pep rallies,” sophomore Ashlyn King said. “The pep rallies are always fun especially when we do the spirit stick because all the drums split up into their grades and sophomores actually won the spirit stick at the last pep rally.” --- King started in the band as a freshman and plays the bass drum in the percussion. --- Sophomore Sam Christie, who plays the quint tenor in the percussion alongside King, joined as a seventh grader and said his favorite part is marching and being with his friends. --- “I made a lot of friends in band, like a lot of really close friends, and I was having fun with it so I decided I would stick with it, and I like playing the drums a lot,” he said. --- When it comes to marching competitions, the band has traveled throughout Oklahoma and even in Texas as part of its 2012 year-end trip. The band received a one, or superior, rating for its performance. --- Willie said that even though it’s scary going against bigger schools in competitions, it’s liberating. --- “Yes it is scary, but it’s also liberating and it’s fun and it’s amazing actually,” she said. “You get this whole amazing feeling because you get to see how long it takes them and you get to go talk to them later and they’ll tell you how they thought of it and how long it took them. I like being able to learn really quickly with them and I think it’s easier. You have to adapt to it, that’s one of the main things.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – For the second time, the Cherokee National Youth Choir has been invited to travel to New York City and sing in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. --- “We are thrilled to be invited back to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade,” choir Director Mary Kay Henderson said. “It is very humbling, and our students take the opportunity very seriously. They know they are representing the Cherokee Nation on the parade route.” --- The choir originally participated in the parade in 2007, and this year, the group practiced weekly and held numerous fundraisers. The tribe will underwrite the majority of the trip. --- The choir, which currently has 28 members, was founded in 2000 to keep youth interested in the culture and involved with speaking the Cherokee language. The choir has produced 11 albums, with the most recent being “Cherokee America” in 2012. --- The song choice for the 2.5-mile parade won’t be revealed until on the parade route.

CATOOSA, Okla. – During the 15th annual American Indian Tourism Conference at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Catoosa, set for Sept. 22-26, the American Indian Alaska Native Tourism Association will present a fashion session called Tourism Trends: Indigenous Fashion. --- The panel consists of three Native designers work with traditional, historic and contemporary fashion. They will describe their journeys in clothing design and how their works are used in living history re-enactments, cultural demonstrations and mainstream fashion events. --- The panel includes Cherokee Nation citizens Tonia Hogner-Weavel and Lisa Rutherford and Chickasaw Nation costume designer Margaret Roach Wheeler. --- “My culture has influenced my work so much and has given me more of a voice in the fashion industry,” Wheeler said. “There is an excitement among people over fashion and designs that relate to cultural history. I'm able to design pieces that reflect tribal traditions, yet make them edgy and modern for today.” --- Wheeler, a Chickasaw textile artist, teaches fashion design to high school students at the Chickasaw Arts Academy. Each year, the academy provides two students with scholarships to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. She is a descendant of the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes. --- Hogner-Weavel, a Cherokee National Treasure for her historic research, designed the period clothing for Diligwa, a 1710 Cherokee Village, and the Cherokee tear dresses for the Cherokee Nation Youth Choir. --- Rutherford is an award-winning artist who recreates southeast appliqué Cherokee beadwork and clothing, using materials as authentic as possible from the late 1700s to early 1800s. She collaborated with Navajo designer Orlando Dugi who took her traditional southeast feather cape and made it haute couture on the runway. --- Other sessions at the conference include tour packaging, attracting tour operators, creating itineraries, positioning tribes for the international tour market, protecting intellectual and cultural property and working with state and federal agencies.

ROSE, Okla. – The Saline District Courthouse got more attention in September as crews worked to restore the roof and add new shingles to it. --- Built in 1884, it’s one of nine Cherokee Nation courthouses built in the 1800s and the only district courthouse still standing. The court had jurisdiction over criminal misdemeanor crimes and civil suits less than $100. --- The restoration phase consists of a new roof structure with new decking and historic-era shingles. The work will help structurally support the building, as well as prevent moisture from destroying the historic materials within the building. --- “This phase is meant to protect and preserve the structure. You’ll see going back on the building is something that will be an era-significant roof style, so it will have cedar shingles and it will look very much like it did when it was courthouse,” Travis Owens of Cherokee Nation Cultural Tourism said. --- He said the CN is funding the $70,000 restoration. --- In 2005, the Tribal Council designated the 14 acres on which the courthouse sits as the tribe’s first national park. It’s located near the Rose community in Mayes County. It also contains a restored stone springhouse, courtyard and streams that flow around the property. --- Restoration of the courthouse and park grounds is being done in phases, with the courthouse as the focus. The non-profit Saline Preservation Association has worked with the CN since 2003 to restore the property. The tribe and CNCT provide assistance and direction in the preservation projects. --- The tribe has worked with the SPA to restore the porch and chimneys, conduct lead-based paint abatement and restore the springhouse. --- In 2010, the SPA received a $4,000 matching grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which was used to work on a plan for a memorial trail on the property. --- “SPA is excited to see the master plan moved forward and this much needed roof replacement completed,” SPA President Lisa Melchior said. “We are always grateful for Cherokee Nation’s support. The new roof will help the structure keep its form, preserve history for future generations and allow us to continue telling the story of the Saline District.” --- With Congress’ passage of the Curtis Act in 1898, the Saline Courthouse was forced to close as the CN’s judicial system was disbanded. Subsequently, the courthouse was sold, and the property and structures had several owners over time. In 1970, the Oklahoma Industrial and Park Department bought the property and structures. The CN received ownership from Oklahoma in 1988. --- “This project is vitally important to the Cherokee Nation and its preservation of history,” Principal Chief Bill John Baker said. “It is one of the few remaining buildings that illustrates that Cherokee people have a distinct government with laws and order. This building is a symbol of our sovereignty.” --- The Saline Courthouse was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. --- The roof restoration was expected to be complete in mid-October. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Three Cherokee artists were honored as Cherokee National Treasures this year before the Cherokee National Holiday during Labor Day weekend. --- One is a talented painter. One is a beadwork artist who brought Southeast beadwork back to the Cherokee people, and the other is a river cane flute maker and cultural specialist. --- Painter Donald Vann, 63, grew up in Stilwell in Adair County mimicking the drawings of his uncles. He spent time in nature camping and hunting with his grandfather. Those memories would one day become a part of his paintings. --- Shortly before his high school graduation, he dropped out and enlisted in the U.S. Army. Vann served in the Vietnam War with the 1st Calvary Aviation Division as a door gunner on a helicopter, dropping off and extracting soldiers from the battlefield. --- After the Army, he began his art career painting the images of his Cherokee heritage. As Native American art’s popularity grew in the 1970s, Vann’s skills were in demand, and he soon found himself with a business partner starting a publishing company called Nuwoduhi Galleries, later renamed Native American Images. Before long, Vann’s artwork was displayed in galleries across the world, on television shows and movies and in the homes and offices of private collectors. --- “If I can make people see with their hearts and feel with their eyes, then I have succeeded,” he said. --- Today, Vann makes his home and studio in Tahlequah with his family. He takes the occasional tour of galleries across the country, but most of his work is now showcased and sold online, including originals, prints and even low-cost posters. --- “Of all the awards I have received throughout my 53 year career, receiving one from my peers and the Cherokee Nation have meant the most to me,” Vann said of the National Treasure Award. “I am honored and thankful.” --- Beadwork artist Martha Berry was born and raised in Tulsa. Her grandmother and mother taught her to sew and embroider at age 5, and she later became a professional seamstress. Berry creates elaborately beaded bandolier bags, moccasins, belts, knee bands, purses and sashes inspired by the styles of Southeastern tribes, including the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Yuchi and Alabama. Her work is displayed in museums throughout the country. --- “When I was first told I had been designated, I thought I’d feel a real sense of completion. Now that it is here, my feeling is much more one of rededication,” Berry said. “I've always wanted to do good work, in order to build my own name. But now, it isn’t just my name on my work. I now represent all the other National Treasures and the Cherokee people as a whole. I’m anxious to do even better work, to continue to live up to the honor and trust that has now been placed in me.” --- Berry, 65, of Tyler, Texas, taught herself the craft of beading and continues to research the beadwork of Southeastern tribes. She said Cherokee beadwork evolved from the trade network Cherokee people established with white traders in the 1600s. Glass seed beads, steel needles, silk thread and ribbon and cloth made of wool were traded for or bought from Europeans. By the late 1700s, Cherokee bead workers were skilled at their craft using trade materials. --- After 1840, Cherokee beadwork and the number of Cherokee bead workers dwindled due mostly to the forced removal of the Cherokees from their Southeastern homelands in 1838-39. Berry said following the removal the Cherokee people had no place in their lives for luxury items such as beaded moccasins, belts and leggings. --- She is credited with helping bring back beadwork to the Cherokee people and teaches others her craft. --- “Although this is the highest honor I have ever received, or will ever receive, I do not feel it closes a circle at all. I feel a rejuvenation, a vigor and an anticipation for the future. I want to make beautiful things. I want to teach more and more people to do the same, and I want to grow more and more teachers of traditional Cherokee beadwork. This wonderful moment is just the beginning,” Berry said. --- Cherokee flutist and cultural specialist Tommy Wildcat of Park Hill has educated people about Cherokee culture since 1988. He works for the Cherokee Nation as a cultural specialist and travels the country with the CN and on his own to share Cherokee culture, language and history. He also shares traditional Cherokee songs using his five-holed Cherokee river can flutes, which he makes by hand. --- Wildcat, 46, was honored as “Flutist of the Year” at the 2002 Native American Music Awards. His music is heard in CN facilities and at many historic sites in northern Georgia. --- “I’m very honored to be a National Treasure. It brings back the many years with my father (Tom), a National Treasure, of the 25 years of learning and teaching our heritage to family and friends, and the thousands of venues that I toured by myself or with my father, family or friends,” Wildcat said. “I’m very happy and grateful for this honor.” --- The Cherokee National Treasure project began in 1988 to honor artisans and preserve and revive artistic practices that may be lost from one generation to the next. They are selected because they have shown skill, cultural and historical knowledge and are committed to education and cultural preservation. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – On Sept. 18, legendary country artist Charley Pride and “The Voice” standouts, the Swon Brothers, will perform a free concert at the Cherokee Nation in the field west of the W.W. Keeler Complex. ---  “We’re truly blessed to have one of country music’s greatest, and Muskogee’s finest, playing here at the Cherokee Nation, where we know their popularity will fill up chairs on every inch of tribal land,” Principal Chief Bill John Baker said. “We wanted to bring this great lineup to our employees, and our greater community, as a way to say thanks for being so good to us all these years.” --- At 14, Pride bought a guitar out of a Sears Roebuck catalog and taught himself to play while listening to the radio. In 1966, he was signed to RCA Records and broke down barriers as country music’s first African-American superstar. The Grammy Award-winner, Grand Ole Opry member and CMA “Entertainer of the Year” is known for hits such as “Kiss An Angel Good Morning,” “Is Anybody Goin’ to San Antone” and “Just Between You and Me.” --- Zach and Colton Swon became overnight sensations as finalists on NBC’s “The Voice,” mentored by Blake Shelton. The Oklahoma natives started performing at the ages of 9 and 11, traveling with their parents’ southern gospel group Exodus. They soon created a following, singing everything from Elvis to Frank Sinatra at a variety show in Wagoner. --- The 5:30 p.m. event is open to the public, who are invited to bring blankets or lawn chairs for the outdoor show. No ice chests or alcohol is permitted. Food vendors will be on site and carpooling is encouraged.

ANADARKO, Okla. – A special solo exhibition of contemporary art including paintings, drawings and mixed media art created by Cherokee artist Roy Boney Jr. is on display through Sept. 21 at the Rosemary Ellison Gallery inside the Southern Plains Indian Museum. --- Boney is a full-blood citizen of the Cherokee Nation and works for the CN Education Services as language technology specialist. He has won awards and honors for his art and has exhibited across the country and internationally, including Art en Capital Salon du Dessin et de la Peinture à l’Eau held in the historic Grand Palais in Paris, France. --- The exhibit features a collection of art that is based in Cherokee stories, language and tradition combined with contemporary elements such as science fiction and rock music. --- One painting titled (Live Long and Prosper) features Sequoyah, the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary, holding his hand up in the familiar “V” gesture that Spock used in the Star Trek series of television shows and films. Another painting titled “A Trip to the Moon” takes the Cherokee story of the frog swallowing the moon during an eclipse and incorporates the famous image of a rocket crash-landed into the Man in the Moon’s eye from silent film “A Trip to the Moon.” Other pieces, such as ‘When She Twirls Her Apron Strange Things Happen,” do not reference classic science fiction but rather tells a family story of a shape shifter. --- Boney considers his art to be an act of storytelling. --- “I am an artist and a Cherokee,” Boney said. “For me the two are intertwined. I cannot separate one from the other. The reason I make art is to tell the stories I heard growing up and to incorporate them into my contemporary interests and lifestyle. Cherokees as a people have always evolved and grown with the times. I want my art to do the same.” --- He added that he is honored to have an exhibition at the Southern Plains Indian Museum. --- “As a Cherokee artist, I understand how important the museum for Native artists. Nearly all the towering figures in Native art have exhibited here such as T.C. Canon and Allan Houser. It has a long history of exhibiting Native artists, and I am humbled to have been offered the invitation for an exhibition,” he said. --- For questions about the exhibition and museum, email Bambi Allen at ---  bambi_allen@ios.doi.gov ---  or call 405-247-6221. --- The museum displays richly varied arts of western Oklahoma tribal peoples, including the Kiowa, Comanche, Kiowa-Apache, Southern Cheyenne, Southern Arapaho, Wichita, Caddo, Delaware and Fort Still Apache. Their historic clothing, shields, weapons, baby carriers and toys highlight the exhibits. --- The museum was founded in 1947-48 through federal and Oklahoma state governments’ cooperative efforts.

GREASY, Okla.
 – Cherokee Nation Industries employees in August collected and delivered more than 400 back-to-school items at Greasy Public Schools in Adair County to help kick off the new academic year at the school’s new elementary building.
 --- “We are really excited to be able to support our local students,”
  CNI employee Donivan Riddle said.
   “I knew our employees would help as much as they could, but I had no idea we could collect this much.”
 --- The donations came at an important time for the school, which serves students in pre-kindergarten through eighth grade.
  August marked the fourth anniversary of a devastating fire that gutted the school’s previous, 60-year-old building and left the district dependent on donations and community support.
 --- School officials said students and families have adjusted since and are glad to be in a permanent building instead of the small, portable units used after the fire.
  However, insurance coverage only funded the actual facility, not furniture, supplies or books.
 --- “The generosity we have experienced has been overwhelming,” Denton Hardbarger, Greasy Elementary School dean of students, said. “It is so much more than we expected. I know the kids will really appreciate it all.”
 --- Greasy Public Schools is also accepting donations of new or used books geared toward pre-kindergarten through eighth grade to fill the empty shelves of the school’s new library.
  Members of the local chapter of Vietnam Veterans of America also donated a $300 check to accompany the items collected by CNI.
 --- For more information about donating, call 918-696-7768.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation signed a 25-year lease on Aug. 8 with the city of Tahlequah to build a splash pad that will be free for all community members – Cherokee and non-Cherokee. --- According to a CN press release, the agreement made with the city allows officials to build the water playground on .72 acres of tribally owned land located downtown. --- “The city will lease the space for $1 a year,” the release states. --- The splash pad, which has yet to be named, will be located at the corner of Downing and Water streets. Mayor Jason Nichols said during the signing that the plan is to have the site constructed by March or early April in 2014. --- “But with the help of the Cherokee Nation we’re going to spend another $183,000…that will put this facility in place that will improve the quality of life for Cherokee children and non-Cherokee children,” Nichols said. --- The splash pad will offer picnic tables, dumping water buckets, a foam pad, water shooters, two water wheels as well as other water-related toys. --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker said that this is the best use of this property. --- “We truly believe that for the next 25 years, this is the highest and best use of that property for the Cherokee Nation,” Baker said. “It will help our youth, the tourism. It helps tie our parks together when we try to attract people to see the courthouse, to see the Supreme Court, to see the jail…this is just one more plus why people might want to come to Tahlequah.” --- Baker added that the partnership between the city and the CN will improve the lives of Cherokee and non-Cherokees alike. --- “…we will continue to develop these kinds of infrastructure improvements for our citizens,” he said. ---  The splash pad is a part of $150 million worth of new infrastructure that’s been planned for or been built in the city during the past several years. --- Northeastern State University is building a new multipurpose event center, and the CN is planning a new $50 million hospital. The city’s sports complex and new swimming pool are future projects, the CN release states. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

STEELEY HOLLOW, Okla. – Even though Cherokee Nation citizen Lorene Drywater became a National Treasure in 1990 for Cherokee traditional clothing, sewing is something she has done all of her life. --- “Just by watching my momma sew,” Drywater said. “She was an expert and then my sister and my cousin. My sister was the oldest and then our cousin was the third or fourth child in the family and she did a lot of sewing. I just learned a little bit of everything.” --- When Drywater, 80, became a Cherokee National Treasure, she didn’t understand what it meant. --- “At first I didn’t know what that was,” she said. “What does it mean? Finally I realized what it meant. That meant I was an old woman.” --- Cherokee National Treasure designations are given annually at the principal chief’s state of the Nation address during the Cherokee National Holiday. The title is given to those who made lifelong commitments to the Cherokee culture through the preservation and revival of traditions that are at risk of being lost. Those recognized are presented with a handmade medallion crafted by Cherokee artisans. --- Drywater said she started sewing as soon as she could hold on to a needle, and when she would visit family, she would look for needles in their yard and house to sew with. --- “Every time we went to visit our kinfolks I would look around in their yard or where they swept the floor in their house and pick up the dirt, dust, whatever, and I would find a needle in it and I would come running back to momma and say ‘here, put this on your dress,’” she said. “That’s how I got my needles, but they were rusty. I was old enough to know what I was doing. I would get that rust off of that needle on a rock and I did a pretty good job of it. Of course, momma would take some.” --- When she was 5, she started making buffalo grass dolls. Once Drywater found the grass she would dig it, take it home, wash it off, make the doll and then dry it. --- “When I get through making these dolls, I line them up and let them get dry,” she said. “That way they will be ready whenever I’m ready for them, then I’ll start making dresses.” --- Drywater said the buffalo grass dolls are her pride and joy. --- “I love it whenever they turn out this way, the right color,” she said. --- After Drywater got married, approximately 50 years ago, she began made traditional clothing again. She made clothing such as Cherokee tear dresses and ribbon shirts and sold them to supplement her income. --- “When I started making them, everybody would come over to my house and would take me over to Muskogee or wherever they wanted to buy the material,” she said. --- Drywater said there weren’t many places to buy material in Tahlequah until Wal-Mart opened. --- “That’s when they turned me loose and told me to get whatever (material) I could and I did,” she said. “I had all of those materials stacked up in my bedroom for when they got ready to order a dress.” --- Drywater started selling the Cherokee dresses at $40, but as the cost of items increased so did the prices. --- She also made a Sequoyah-styled jacket for former Principal Chief Chad Smith. --- “She’s not only one of the sweetest Cherokee woman you could ever find, she shows determination, creativity, she’s such a delight to be around,” Smith said. “Everybody would be blessed to have a mother, aunt or grandmother like her.” --- Along with making traditional clothing and buffalo grass dolls, Drywater also makes small turtles out of felt material that she sells as pincushions. --- “Our people always believed that turtles were a very important animal,” she said. “They had told us that ‘you take that home with you, if it’s dead, set it up somewhere along the edge of the roof of your house because a turtle doesn’t get blown away.’ And if you have a turtle sitting up there along the edge of your roof your house won’t get blown away.” --- In 2011, Drywater decided to sell most of her items at an art show at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Catoosa. One of her tear dresses placed third, so she decided to keep. --- After spending a lifetime of making Cherokee traditional clothing, turtles and buffalo grass dolls, Drywater has decided to take a break from sewing. --- “Now I don’t do that much sewing for other people because there are a lot of other people out there that learned how to sew,” she said. --- And although she may not sew as much as she used to, she still likes to get out her items every once in a while to admire them. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee artist and Vietnam veteran Donald Vann began creating art as a young man growing up in Stilwell in Adair County. --- He later became one of the most well-known Native American artists in the country with works that blend Cherokee culture and personal experiences to provide a sense of peace. --- Vann, 63, grew up mimicking the drawings of his uncles. The first piece of artwork he ever sold was a drawing of Christ on the cross for a local church. He was 10 years old and was paid 75 cents. --- When he started Stilwell Junior High, the principal, Dr. Neil Morton, was introduced to Vann’s talent when he asked some students where they got their Beatles T-shirts and found that Vann was the source. Morton recognized that Vann was not like other students and enrolled him in an alternative program, buying him painting supplies and allowing him to paint murals on the school’s walls for two hours every day. --- “At that time, school wasn’t made for people like Donald. School was a square hole, and Donald was a round peg in a square hole,” Morton, now the senior advisor to Cherokee Nation Education Services, said. “I’m extremely proud of being a small part of not only Donald’s life, but for assisting him in finding himself in the media of art.” --- Morton’s assessment of Vann’s academic needs went ignored when he progressed to high school, where he struggled. Vann dropped out and moved to Montana. There he attended Job Corps, graduating at 14 with his general education development degree. He later returned to Oklahoma to re-enter high school. --- During this time, Vann met Muscogee Creek artist Jerome Tiger and Tiger’s agent Nettie Wheeler. Through Tiger, Vann’s natural talent and cultural influences became honed and developed beyond the expectations of one so young. --- “I was his first and only student he ever had that actually came to his house and painted on his work table,” Vann said. “I was so impressed and in awe with Jerome. He and Nettie are who really got me started.” --- Shortly before his high school graduation, he dropped out again and enlisted in the U.S. Army. Vann served in the Vietnam War and with the 1st Calvary Aviation Division. He served as a door gunner on a helicopter, dropping off and extracting soldiers from the battlefield, but was still able to put his artistic skills to work. --- “I did insignias on helicopters and insignias on CO’s (commanding officer) helmets. They liked that,” Vann said. “I did some Indian images on the noses of some helicopters, like feather tomahawks or a cartoon-looking Indian coming at you with a bow and arrow and a knife. Most of our helicopters were named after Indians at that time, like Iroquois and Apache. And stuff like that got me points with my ranking officers.” --- In November 1969, Vann’s helicopter was shot down. Only he and his crew chief survived the crash. After recovering from his injuries, Vann rejoined his unit in Fort Hood, Texas, where he was assigned to desk duty and went on to be a drill instructor. In March 1973, he received an honorable discharge, accruing the Purple Heart, National Defense, Good Conduct, Vietnam Campaign and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign medals. --- After being discharged, Vann attempted to move back to Adair County but was unable to find the peace he felt in Texas, so he moved to Austin where he stayed nearly 40 years. --- As Native American art’s popularity grew in the early 1970s, Vann’s skills were in high demand, and he found himself with a business partner starting a publishing company called Nuwoduhi Galleries, later renamed Native American Images. Before long, Vann’s artwork was being displayed in galleries across the world, on television shows and movies and in the homes and offices of private collectors. --- “If I can make people see with their hearts and feel with their eyes, then I have succeeded,” he said. --- Today, Vann makes his home and studio in Tahlequah with his family. He takes the occasional tour to galleries across the country, but most of his work is now showcased and sold online, including originals, prints and posters. --- On June 10, Vann was one of three veterans honored with a Cherokee Warrior Medal by the CN during its Tribal Council meeting. After the meeting, he signed and gave away posters of his work. --- “I think these kind of honors are long overdue for all veterans, not just the ones who were here tonight,” Vann said. “I think it’s time our nations, not just Cherokee, honor our veterans regardless of what wars that they were involved in to let people know that we have warriors among us that are not recognized.”

TULSA, Okla. – The Oaks Indian Mission recently honored Cherokee Nation Entertainment employee Jimmie Marrujo as an outstanding alumnus. He attended the mission in Oaks 40 years ago. --- According to a CNE press release, Marrujo, who is Cherokee and Pueblo and works at the Cherokee Hills Golf Course in Catoosa, is a positive role model for Native American youth, even more so for those students coming from Oaks. --- “Marrujo attended Oaks Indian Mission throughout high school and graduated in 1962. The award recognizes Marrujo as an inspirational alumnus who has created a lasting, positive impact on Oaks Indian Mission,” the release states. --- Marrujo spent 11 years playing professional baseball. He played two years with players such as Mickey Mantle and Rich Barry as a member of the New York Yankees. --- “Oaks will always be near and dear to my heart because I grew up there and it’s where I made lifetime friends,” Marrujo said. “It helped me adjust to the outside world, and people outside of my family.” --- Marrujo has been married to his wife Jessica for 45 years, and spends a great deal of time with his son and grandson. --- He’s been a employee at Cherokee Hill Golf Club since 2004 and said enjoys his job more than playing professional baseball, but still enjoys watching the game. --- According to the release, Oaks officials contend that his inspirational story and continued efforts to bring awareness to the Oaks Indian Mission make him much more than that to the children who live there now. --- Oaks Indian Mission, located in Delaware County, is a nonprofit, privately funded shelter alternative for Native American children ages 4 to 18.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Former Sequoyah High School football standout and Cherokee Nation citizen Nathan Stanley signed a free agent deal on April 27 with the Baltimore Ravens as the 2013 NFL Draft concluded its annual three-day event. --- Stanley completed his final two seasons of college football playing quarterback for Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, La. The 6-foot-5-inch quarterback threw for 1,952 yards, the eighth-highest single-season total in school history, while throwing for nine touchdowns in 2012. --- The Tahlequah native, who played in the Casino del Sol All-Star Game and East-West Shrine Game, finished his two-year career sixth in SLU history in passing yards (2,238), sixth in completions (205) and seventh in attempts (385). --- Before transferring to SLU, Stanley played two seasons for the University of Mississippi Rebels in Oxford, Miss. He redshirted in 2008 during his freshman year at Ole Miss. --- Stanley was the starting quarterback his second season in 2010 before Oregon transfer Jeremiah Masoli took over. Stanley started the season opener against Jacksonville State, going 6-of-10 for 133 yards and three touchdowns. Masoli took over after that and Stanley only saw the field three more times last season. --- After Masoli left, Stanley figured to get the majority of the action at quarterback, but improvements by junior college transfer Randall Mackey, junior college transfer Zack Stoudt and West Virginia transfer Barry Brunetti diminished his reps, which led to his transfer to SLU. --- Stanley finishes his career at Ole Miss going 28-for-55 for 424 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions. --- In 2008, Stanley was one of the country’s most sought after quarterback recruits, when he chose Mississippi over schools such as Oregon State, Maryland and Louisiana Tech. --- As a four-year starter at Sequoyah, he passed for more than 6,000 yards and 70 touchdowns for the Indians, including 2,265 yards and 34 touchdowns in 2007. As a recruit, he was No. 11 in Oklahoma on ---  Rivals.com . He was also named the National Quarterback of the Year at the second annual Offense/Defense All-American Bowl awards in Miami, Fla. Stanley’s other accolades include being named to the 2008 Oklahoma Coaches Association All-State Game, set for Aug. 1 at a site to be determined; Tulsa’s Channel 8 Player of the Week, which put him in the running for the Channel 8 Ford Player of the Year Award; the 2007 Class 2A-8 All-District Team and co-Offensive Back of the Year; and a spot on the Class 2A All-State Team. --- Currently, the Ravens have Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco as their starter. Flacco signed a $120.6 million contract earlier this year, the richest in NFL history at the time. --- Other quarterbacks on the Ravens roster are Caleb Hanie, a six-year pro from the University of Colorado and Tyrod Taylor, a three-year veteran from Virginia Tech.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – When women in the community are down on their luck, they need not worry. Encore Resale, a store branched through the city’s Help-In-Crisis center is there to help them during their times of need. --- The shop was founded in 2009 to help fund Help-In-Crisis, a women’s shelter that helps needy women. Proceeds from Encore Resale help fund the shelter’s bills and payroll, as well as meet both outlets’ needs. --- The shop is open to all, but needy women can go to Help-In-Crisis and get a voucher to shop for free. --- “Years ago, people would donate stuff to the office…but it got so much that they needed a place to put it,” Bobbie Smith, Encore Resale manager and Cherokee Nation citizen, said. “So they set up a resale shop. It’s kind of a two-way benefit. It helps funds us and also gives to the community.” --- At the first of each month, the shop has different types of bag sales, which help move products and aid needy community members. --- “This community is not a rich community,” Smith said. “This store actually benefits a lot of people because we have really good prices and we have a lot of good quality stuff.” --- Encore Resale is also always in need of volunteers, particularly in the summer because it’s yard sale season and the donations pile up quickly and volunteers are scarce because people are enjoying the season. --- “Whenever yard sale season is in full swing, we have more donations in a day then we can process and so we kind of get a little backed up,” Smith said. --- Encore Resale will accept donations at any time, but Smith said she prefers to take them during normal business hours so items do not have to sit for long periods of time. People can also donate directly to Help-In-Crisis. --- “Our shelter is in need of towels,” she said. “The shelter is always in need of bath items, underwear and socks.” --- People from all over donate for different reasons. Some donate to help women get back on their feet. --- “I decided to donate my belongings to this organization because it empowers women to have a better quality of life,” Guinnevere Allen of Elden said. “I strongly believe in this organization.” --- Many CN citizens receive help from Help-In-Crisis and Encore Resale, and many CN citizens shop at Encore Resale to help those in need or just to shop at a store with fair prices. --- Smith said the shop also has a lot of Native American artworks and different items that show a glimpse into the Native American culture. She added that having these pieces helps others see into the Cherokee culture. --- “Heritage in this community is very strong,” she said. “Knowing that we have that (artwork and clothing) donated and sold also helps to enrich the culture here to maybe people who wouldn’t necessarily go out to the Cherokee Heritage Center to purchase Cherokee clothing and artwork and stuff like that, to be able to come here and see it, where they wouldn’t normally.” --- The shop not only benefits women who seek help, but also college students who receive CN scholarships in order to fulfill the scholarships’ volunteer requirements. Students perform various tasks such as sorting through items and decorating mannequins. Smith said she values the students’ time spent helping keep the shop on track. --- “Whenever they come and volunteer they only get to spend a few hours,” she said. “What’s really great is they love to decorate. We have a lot of really excellent volunteers that come in from the CN scholarship program, and I really value their help because they really do help make a difference because every little bit helps.” --- For more information, call Smith at 918-453-0466 or visit Encore Resale at 109 N. College Ave., to shop or donate. ---  stacie-guthrie@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000 ext. 5903

SALLISAW, Okla. – The Sallisaw Dialysis Center opened and served its first patient in March thanks to a partnership between the Cherokee Nation, Tahlequah City Hospital and DaVita Dialysis. --- Dialysis services are available for both Native American and non-Native patients, and the center allows for area patients to travel less when needing dialysis. --- Tom Reed, the center’s first patient, said having the center in Sallisaw is more convenient for him. --- “I used to have to drive one and a half hours, each way, twice a week for treatments,” he said. --- Nephrologist Dr. James Madison, who is also the center’s director, stated in a TCH press release that there is evidence showing that patients who travel less for treatment have better outcomes. --- “I have 18 to 20 patients who travel for dialysis,” he said. “This new location will have a tremendous impact on their well-being.” --- Connie Davis, CN Health Services executive director, said the partnering groups hoped to have a grand opening for the facility in April. She said she agreed with Madison that having the facility is a benefit to the patients and the Sallisaw community. --- “That community’s dialysis patients can be seen in their own community whereas they were driving to Stilwell, Fort Smith and I believe Poteau for dialysis services,” she said. --- The dialysis center is located next to the tribe’s Redbird Smith Health Center. According to TCH officials, the Tahlequah Hospital Foundation built the center and DaVita Dialysis operates it. Physicians of the Tahlequah Medical Group, Madison and Dr. Kinya Kamau provide patient care. --- Madison said it is through these partnerships that patients are able to receive excellent and convenient care. --- “We are able to offer services to help curb the health burden of those living in northeastern Oklahoma,” he said. “There are 35 million Americans who suffer from chronic kidney disorders. I am proud to partner with the Cherokee Nation, who has a vision to address these health issues.” --- The land used to build the facility is owned by the CN. The tribe leases the land to TCH. --- The CN and TCH broke ground on the facility in November 2010. Tribal Councilor Janelle Fullbright of Sallisaw said at that time that the center was one of the reasons she ran for council. --- “This is greatly needed and I am so excited to be here today,” she said. “This is a dream come true.” --- At the groundbreaking, fellow Tribal Councilor David Thornton of Vian said he had friends who traveled far from home to receive dialysis and was happy the tribe was doing something to ease that burden. --- “None of them are here with us today. I watched them have to travel long distances and it was a hardship on them and their families for them to receive the care they needed. I am glad we are now able to provide this service to others,” he said. --- The facility, which was designed by Ambler Architects and built by Bolt Construction, can serve 60 patients. Estimates show that more than 90 percent of those patients will be Cherokee. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizens and language technology specialists – Roy Boney Jr., Jeff Edwards and Joseph Erb – have been instrumental in expanding the Cherokee language with 21st century technologies. --- Advancements include the language’s availability on the iPhone, iPad and iPod, as well as on Google and in Google email. The journey to get the language where it is today has been interesting, Boney said, because each man has different skills and interests, which when combined create ideas that further the language. --- “It all comes back to Joseph, Jeff and I. We’re artists. We’re not computer technicians or anything. So this kind of goes back to finding a creative solution to a problem that we may have,” Boney said. “The problem was that the Cherokee language is not supported on computers and other devices, so we decided ‘hey we got to fix this.’ And getting there, we may not have had the technical skills, but we had the ability to come up with a solution.” --- He said a big part of the job is creativity, but having an adventurous streak, such as asking Apple to add the Cherokee language on its products, doesn’t hurt. --- “You don’t know if they’re going to do it or not, but they did end up helping us, so we’re risk takers and we enjoy our work,” he said. “We have fun and we work together real well. We collaborate a lot and constantly bounce ideas off each other.” --- Boney said he, Erb, Edwards, as well as language translator Durbin Feeling, ensure the language is compatible with technology and that the effort began nearly five years ago while he and Erb were creating materials for the Cherokee Language Immersion School. --- “The school at the time had been going for a couple years or so and they needed technology in the classroom because they were doing everything by hand. So the goal was so they could use their tools in their language. And that kind of led to working with Apple,” he said. “So we introduced the MacBook’s into the Cherokee classes and that kind of took off. At this time it was right when the iPhone came out. So our assumption was if Apple can put it on the desktop system it should go in the phone.” --- Soon after, a partnership was formed with Apple to design a keyboard. --- “Now every Apple device, mobile device, the iPhone, the iPod, the iPad, they all support the Cherokee language. You can type in Cherokee. You can text. You can email…you can do all this in the language. And this is right on the device,” he said. “There is no app to download. It’s actually part of it. So this development caused a lot of interest in the Cherokee language around the world and that led to further partnerships.” --- Boney said some of the other partnerships are with Facebook and Microsoft, including a Microsoft translation project that is one of the largest in modern history. In late 2012, Cherokee became the first Native American language to be integrated into a Windows system. Sixteen CN language translators and other staff members worked with Microsoft to prepare the integration of Cherokee into Windows 8. Cherokee translators translated more than 180,000 words, the largest Cherokee translation project since the Bible was translated in the 1800s. --- “It could not have been done without our translators. Durbin Feeling was the lead translator on that project. And they had to come up with these new terms for this new technology, which did not exist in Cherokee. So that was quite a challenge,” Boney said. --- He said when one looks at Cherokee history, the Cherokee people have always adapted well to the times. --- “Like when the trading began with the Europeans, we took their materials and we would use it for our own purposes…so there is always an adaptation to technology,” Boney said. “So when Sequoyah invented the writing system, initially it was handwritten. The Cherokee Nation decided ‘hey, we need to go to a printing press,’ so they modified it to fit the printing press, which is the technology of that time. And that led to typewriters, to computers to fonts. So there’s this line of continuation of technology that we’re always adopting.” --- Edwards said his job is to work with major technology companies to get the Cherokee language represented on the companies’ products. --- “Their devices, operating systems, Internet – just anything dealing with technology – we try to get the Cherokee language supported on it,” he said. “It is pretty crazy work, but we do it so much and we’ve done it for so many years it’s kind of just like every day life. It’s very rewarding in the end.” --- Erb said digitizing the Cherokee language and ensuring its accessibility on many types of electronic devices is necessary for the language’s continuation. --- “To make sure that from now on our language will be used in the communities at lightning speed…that’s really exciting to see Cherokee in text messaging and email,” he said. “We’re pretty pleased with the last few years in this department and how we’ve been able to kind of come together and make some big things happen.” --- Erb said if substantial jumps in the Cherokee language’s use do not continue as technology does, the language could be lost for future Cherokee speakers. --- “We’re an endangered language, so we have to make sure that this occurs,” he said. “We’re really proud that we’ve been able to accomplish what we can.” --- Boney said “more stuff” is in the works, though it cannot be shared publicly yet, because language technological advances will help sustain the Cherokee language. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Marty Ward, head coach of the men’s lacrosse team at Florida Southern College, is a Cherokee Nation, Iroquois citizen and the only Native American head lacrosse coach at a major university in the country. --- Ward enters his third season as head coach for FSC in Lakeland with an 18-12 overall record in his first two seasons. --- Under Ward, the Moccasins have posted back-to-back winning seasons and reached the Deep South Conference Championship both years. --- The Mocs finished the 2012 season receiving votes in the final United State Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association Coaches Poll after posting a 10-6 overall record and 6-2 mark in the conference championship. The year was highlighted by a six-game win streak at the end of the season going into the conference title game where Ward’s team lost. --- The Syracuse, N.Y., native said it’s an honor being one of the first Native American lacrosse head coach in the NCAA. --- “My heritage has helped me embody the kind of man, the kind of husband, the kind of son, the kind of brother that I want to be,” Ward said. “It’s made me find myself a little bit…understand that I give thanks to everything, every day.” --- Ward said he remembers playing lacrosse his whole life and could not think of anything that suits him more. --- “Lacrosse is a way of life,” he said. --- This past summer, Ward served as an assistant coach served for the Iroquois Nationals Under-19 Program that won a bronze medal at the 2012 Federation of International Lacrosse U-19 World Championships in Turku, Finland. --- He is also set to play goalie for the Iroquois Nationals at the 2014 World Lacrosse Championship in Denver, a position he played in 2006 for the team. Ward said playing for the Iroquois team and just to be able to wear the Iroquois jersey on the field is an honor. --- “The Iroquois National team represents the creators of the game lacrosse,” he said. “As it being a Native game, this was really a special honor for me playing with them in (20)06.” --- The Iroquois Nationals are the first Native American lacrosse team to compete on an international level. The team consists of players from the six nations of the Iroquois. In 1998, the team began competing in the World Lacrosse Championship. --- However, after the 2014 world tournament, Ward said he plans to focus more on the sport’s coaching side. --- “This is going to be my last world games to play in as a player,” he said. “I’m more in the coaching realm now than the playing realm. So this is my last opportunity to get out there and compete for a medal with the Iroquois Nationals team.” --- In 2012, he served as an Iroquois Nationals assistant coach. At the World Lacrosse Championship, the team beat the United States team for the first time, a great accomplishment considering it was Team USA’s second loss in 40 matches for the year. --- In college, Ward played goalkeeper at Limestone College in South Carolina. He posted a 55-9 career record at the school and was a two-time team captain. --- In 2008, he served as a Limestone College student assistance coach before being hired as lacrosse coach in 2009 at Heathwood Hall Episcopal School in S.C. ---  stacie-guthrie@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000 ext. 5903

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – On Feb. 12, more than 35 female cancer survivors with nearly 250 combined years of survivorship gathered at Sequoyah Schools’ The Place Where They Play to be honored during the fifth annual Think Pink basketball game. --- The event allows cancer survivors to gather and be honored after the Sequoyah girls games for their survivorship. --- “They honor them on the floor at the end of the girls game,” Barbara Neal, Cherokee Nation Cancer Programs health educator, said. “In the meantime, we have a little reception and visit with our breast cancer survivors. There are several ladies that come every year. We have a lot of new faces each year, too. And it’s just a good time to get together, get to visit, renew acquaintances and just get to sit down and talk to each other.” --- CN citizen Ruby Wells, an 11-year breast cancer survivor from Welling, said she’s attended Think Pink event at Sequoyah every year. --- “I was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer in 2001. I had no idea I had cancer. I had found it, located the lump myself,” Wells said. --- She said she found the lump about six months after having a check-up. --- “But through self-education and self-breast exam, I found it myself. And at that time I immediately had surgery. The biopsy was done and I was at a Stage 4. If I hadn’t located the mass, I probably would not be here today,” Wells said. --- United Keetoowah Band citizen Georgia Reese Hogner of Briggs is a breast cancer survivor of 23 years. She was diagnosed in 1989 and had a mastectomy in 1990. She said she likes to attend the event because of the fellowship she has with fellow cancer survivors. --- “You know, just to draw encouragement from each other,” she said. “I’m thankful we have this. It helps us to realize we’re not alone. We’re not going through this alone. There’s other people that are actually worse off than we are. Here I am 23 years being well. I guess I’m considered cured now though and that’s good.” --- Betty Mouse, also a UKB citizen and 23-year cancer survivor, said she’s had several cancer recurrences in different parts of her body but is grateful to be alive and attend the Think Pink event. --- “It helps to realize that there are others who have gone through or are going through the same thing that I have and they are still here and very much active,” she said. --- Mouse suggested to others who are going through cancer or have a family member fighting the disease is to “keep hoping, keep the faith” and “a lot of prayer.” --- Neal said she educates CN citizens on breast and cervical cancers and that early detection is key to winning the battle. --- “It is my pleasure to be able to go out and visit with ladies that are getting mammograms. And I do one-on-one education with ladies that get their mammogram. I’m able to sit down and visit with them and tell them the importance of getting a mammogram,” she said. “I also set up health fairs. I get to go out and visit with people in the 14 counties and we just talk about the importance of mammograms, checking for breast cancer and also cervical cancer.” --- The next event for breast cancer survivors is the 14th annual Breast Cancer Survivor Dinner set for Oct. 12. --- For more information, call Neal at 918-453-5138. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – High school juniors and home-schooled students who are Cherokee Nation citizens and live within the tribe’s 14-county jurisdiction – as well as contiguous counties in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas – are now eligible for tribal concurrent enrollment scholarships. --- Concurrent enrollment is where a high school or home-schooled student is concurrently enrolled in an accredited public or private institution of higher learning. --- Previously the scholarships were offered only to eligible high school seniors. However, at its Feb. 11 meeting, the Tribal Council unanimously amended the Concurrent Enrollment Scholarship Act of 2011 to allow more students to apply for the scholarships. --- According to the act, eligible students will receive funding from the CN to supplement the tuition that Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education ordinarily pays for high school senior tuition. Students will receive funding for tuition fees and other costs so that concurrent enrollment costs will be minimal for both high school or home-schooled juniors and seniors. --- “This is an act that’s going to pay for juniors that are concurrently enrolled,” said Tribal Councilor David Walkingstick. “Right now the higher regents don’t pay for juniors tuition, but this amendment will pay for the tuition of juniors.” --- Walkingstick, the sponsor of the 2011 act, also sponsored the amendment after hearing of the need for it from Tribal Councilor Jodie Fishinghawk. --- “Councilwoman Fishinghawk is the one who brought this to my attention,” he said. “There were some juniors in Adair County, I had some as well in Muskogee County, that were needing this assistance.” --- As director of Indian Education for Muskogee Public Schools he said he sees “struggling Native American students” trying to break family trends to get college educations. --- “I see too many Cherokee college freshmen and sophomores drop out because they don’t think college is for them,” Walkingstick said. “When that happens, we lose out on our investment to help them. This gets our students in the door earlier, gets them comfortable with college and able to finish high school and most of their freshman year of college at the same time. All of these things give our students a better chance of graduating.” --- According to the tribe’s website, the CN has paid about $85,000 this school year in concurrent enrollment scholarships to help 214 CN students earn up to six college credits per semester. --- The act states that an eligible student attending a public high school must submit a verification letter from the school counselor showing concurrent enrollment eligibility. If the student is home schooled, the student must submit verification showing eligibility from the individual providing the home schooling. --- When applying, students must also submit a current college class schedule and cost verification. --- Eligible students can receive a scholarship of $250 for three credit hours and $500 for six credit hours each semester. Students can also receive a tuition waiver equivalent to the amount of resident tuition for a maximum of six credit hours per semester at a college or university in the Oklahoma State System of Higher Education as a special student. --- Applications for the fall 2013 semester are now available. For more information, call the CRC at 918-453-5465 or toll free at 1-800-256-0761. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla.
--- Since nine Cherokee Language Immersion School graduates started the seventh grade at Sequoyah Schools, their use of the tribe’s tongue has dwindled from speaking it all day to speaking during short lessons and breaks.
--- Immersion school Principal Holly Davis said Sequoyah has made efforts to continue the immersion graduates’ learning of the Cherokee language, but that it’s a work in progress. 
--- “We want to expose them to the language daily, and it’s just getting that perfect schedule together and we get closer every time. So eventually we’ll get there, but we are providing those opportunities to speak Cherokee everyday,” she said.
--- In May 2012, the students who attended the immersion school since its inception were the first sixth graders to graduate into Sequoyah’s seventh grade. They are Cambria Bird, Emilee Chavez, Cheyenne Drowingbear, Cree Drowingbear, Lauren Grayson, Alayna Harkreader, Lauren Hummingbird, Sean Sikora and Maggie Sourjohn.
--- Cheyenne Drowingbear said it’s been difficult transitioning into using English all the time instead of Cherokee.
--- “The transition has been taking an effect on us because you’ve gone from speaking Cherokee, reading, writing nothing but Cherokee to everyday English, and the hardest thing for me is not speaking Cherokee,” she said.
--- While attending the immersion school, the students studied Cherokee culture and history, as well as subjects such as science and math. English was introduced to them in the fifth and sixth grades to help transition them into seventh grade.
--- “When I started here and they were fifth graders we knew we needed to start preparing for seventh grade because we knew they would be in an English environment again, but we wanted them to have Cherokee,” Davis said. “We don’t want them to lose those years that we put into them as speakers.”
--- Since the immersion school graduates started the seventh grade, Davis said Sequoyah officials have tried incorporating the Cherokee language for them.
--- “We want to provide a quality education, and we want to provide the opportunity to continue the Cherokee language,” she said. “These kids have invested 10 years of their life in it, and we want to them to have that opportunity to continue to grow with that.” 
--- The school incorporated Cherokee into their lessons at the beginning of school year by having the immersion school’s sixth grade teacher go to Sequoyah and teach science in Cherokee for more than nine weeks. However, the instructors felt the graduates weren’t getting enough Cherokee conversation. So the sixth grade teaching assistant took them on nature walks for conversations. Both efforts continued until Christmas break.
--- “We know we need to do better. We just can’t find that perfect schedule combination yet, so right now what we’re doing is Mr. (Jim) Carey, the high school Cherokee teacher, has become involved,” Davis said. “He cannot wait to get a hold of the immersion kids, so he now comes in daily and has short Cherokee lessons everyday.”
--- Cheyenne Drowningbear said a lot of what Carey is teaching all of Sequoyah’s seventh graders is basic Cherokee, but that doesn’t stop the immersion graduates from speaking Cherokee.
--- “He comes in and teaches us the basics. It’s basic Cherokee I, so he’s teaching the rest of them dog, cat and everything, but we’re way past that. But we’re still speaking it around each other,” she said.
--- Davis said because other students who didn’t attend the immersion school have become interested in learning Cherokee, the school created a Cherokee club. As for the immersion graduates, she said the plan is to have them get more advanced in speaking Cherokee in each grade by continued speaking and learning and keeping the lessons engaging.
--- “We are offering Cherokee. We just can’t get the right combination yet. But we give it a while, we evaluate and then we adjust,” she said. “That’s really all we can do right now.”

NORMAN, Okla. – Registration is open for Camp ClapHans, a new residential summer camp for children with special needs. --- The camp, which opens in June, is for youth ages 8 to 16 and is an outreach project of the J.D. McCarty Center for children with developmental disabilities in Norman. The camp is located on the center’s campus at 2002 E. Robinson St. and features two cabins and an activities building that are located next to an 11-acre lake. --- The deadline to register is May 24. The cost for a weekly camp session is $325, and scholarships are available to families who qualify. --- Camp sessions will take place in June and July and will feature themes that focus on different disabilities, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, physical disabilities, autism, intellectual disabilities, feeding disorders and sensory issues. --- “We will work with families to determine the camp session that will best fit their child’s abilities and interests,” camp director Megan Stanek said. --- Camp activities will include archery, arts and crafts, canoeing, fishing, field games, horseback riding, hikes and swimming. --- Stanek said she is thrilled about opening the camp and sees it as a place where children can have fun, make friends and learn valuable skills. --- “We have an exciting summer full of activities, exploration and social programs for our campers,” she said. “We are beyond excited in taking another big step toward beginning a new project of the J.D. McCarty Center.” --- The idea for the camp developed in 1995 when McCarty Center officials discussed options on how to reach more kids with disabilities in the summer months when they are out of school and not receiving therapeutic services, Vicki Kuestersteffen, director and CEO of the center, said. --- The camp was seen as a way to “reach kids in a fun and exciting way and integrate therapy so that we could maintain or increase their functional level,” she said. --- Officials broke ground on the camp in October 2008. --- The camp is named in honor of the late Sammy Jack Claphan, a Cherokee Nation citizen and a Stilwell, Okla., native. --- Claphan played football at the University of Oklahoma and graduated with a degree in special education. He later played in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns and the San Diego Chargers. After retiring from the NFL, he returned to Oklahoma and became a special education teacher. He died in 2001. --- Camp registration ends May 24. To register, call 405-307-2814 or email ---  mstanek@jdmc.org .

OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activities Association closed its investigation into Sequoyah High School athletics on Feb. 6, choosing to issue no further sanctions against the school’s athletic programs. --- The OSSAA board unanimously accepted an internal audit compiled by Sequoyah officials. The audit included recent policy changes, such as ensuring student athletes complete the correct forms upon enrollment, guaranteeing all coaches are trained on athletic rules, as well as other preventive measures. --- “We choose to be a member of the association and understand we must follow their rules, as do our coaches, parents, students and community,” SHS Superintendent Leroy Qualls said. “I think the cloud has lifted at Sequoyah High School now that this investigation is over, and we are grateful our school and students can move forward.” --- OSSAA Executive Director Ed Sheakley said throughout the process Qualls and Athletic Director Marcus Crittenden had done nothing but cooperate with the investigation. --- “You can see in their report everything was not pretty, but they are making changes and do want to be a good member, putting policies and procedures in place,” Sheakley said. --- SHS was found to have violated OSSAA rules and regulations regarding student athlete eligibility, resulting in the forfeiture of the entire 2012 football season as well as individual student play for many of Sequoyah’s gifted athletes. OSSAA found the violations went back several years.

CLAREMORE, Okla. – For several years, Dist. 5 Tribal Councilor Cara Cowan Watts has hosted workshops to inform students about where to find and apply for scholarships other than those from the Cherokee Nation. On Jan. 12, more than 200 students and parents attended her 2013 workshop. --- She, along with Cherokee Nation Foundation Executive Director Kimberlie Gilliland, provided information on classes to take in grades eighth through 12th to prepare students for college, entrance exams, finding scholarships, managing scholarship applications, networking, best social media practices, building a resume’ for success, recommendation letters, choosing career paths and filing for financial aid. --- “The cost of college is rising and not everyone applies for the Cherokee Nation grant or can qualify for the tribal monies,” Cowan Watts said. “If folks simply Google, they will find an amazing amount of resources to pay for college without going into student loan debt, if they have focused on doing their job as a student in school. Tribal higher education grants should not be a student’s only source of income for school.” --- One item that stuck out for United Keetoowah Band citizen Brionna Badoni, 16, was to be cautious of posts on the social network Facebook because future employers or scholarship distributors may look at the page. --- “It’s really interesting. I didn’t get to come last year. We’ve wanted to come for the last couple of years but we’ve made a point to come this year because she’s getting older,” said Donna Badoni, Brionna’s mother. --- Brionna, of Owasso, said she plans to attend the University of Oklahoma after high school. --- Gilliland focused on financial aid and the Free Application For Federal Student Aid process, college admissions process and college prep opportunities in general and as provided by the CNF. --- “I hope students will obtain more scholarship and grant monies for college, so they may focus on their studies rather than worrying about student loans, bursar bills or working while going to school,” Cowan Watts said. --- The free seminar also included a student panel that answered questions and provide first-hand experiences and lessons learned from the scholarship search and college application process. The students represented the University of Oklahoma, Bacone College, Northeastern State University and the University of Arkansas. --- Cowan Watts said while attending Oklahoma State University she chaired the American Indian Science and Engineering Society scholarship committee and discovered she had a passion for helping others find resources. --- “After graduating from college, I started doing the presentation when asked by organizations and student groups,” she said. “The demand has been high every year for the information I share during the workshop, so I have continued to update and add new topics to the workshop as technology changes. I love sharing with our students and helping them be successful. Others helped me during high school and college, so I am passing it on as I was taught.” --- Parents and students also gathered information from booths set up by Bacone, the University of Arkansas, Cherokee Nation Businesses, CN Career Services, CNF, League of Women Voters of the CN, Cherokee Phoenix and Dist. 5 Tribal Councilors Buel Anglen and Lee Keener. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Northeastern State University President Steve Turner and Oklahoma College of Optometry Dean Dr. Doug Penisten presented a resolution honoring the Cherokee Nation at the Jan. 14 Tribal Council meeting. --- Turner said the Association of Schools and Colleges of Optometry voted to honor the CN with the resolution. ASCO represents all 23 schools and colleges of optometry in the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. --- “There have been a number of partnerships that predate everyone in this room between Northeastern State and the Cherokee Nation. We’re here tonight to present a very special award recognizing at least 25 years of partnership between the Cherokee Nation and the Oklahoma College of Optometry,” Turner said. --- Penisten said the partnership is recognized nationwide as a model for the delivery of health care in a rural setting. --- “This resolution...commends the commitment of the Cherokee Nation to provide its citizens with the highest quality in health care,” Penisten said. “ASCO also wishes the acknowledge the truly unprecedented and remarkable partnership between the Cherokee Nation and Northeastern State University Oklahoma College of Optometry.” --- NSUOCO faculty, residents and students provide optometry and eye care services at the tribe’s eight clinics: the Wilma P. Mankiller Health Center in Stilwell, Redbird Smith Health Center in Sallisaw, Sam Hider Community Clinic in Jay, Amo Community Clinic in Salina, Bartlesville Health Clinic, Three Rivers Health Center in Muskogee, Will Rogers Health Center in Nowata and the Vinita Health Center. Services are also provided at W.W. Hastings Hospital in Tahlequah and the NSUOCO Campus Clinic on the NSU campus. --- Annually, NSUOCO students, residents and faculty experience more than 50,000 patient encounters, according to information provided by the NSUOCO. --- The partnership also plays a role in setting a standard of excellence in education for optometric students, Penisten said. --- “The eye and vision care provided by the faculty, residents and students of the Oklahoma College of Optometry is recognized as the highest and most advanced level of care of any optometry program in the world,” he said. --- The resolution was presented to Principal Chief Bill John Baker during the council meeting. --- “It’s ironic they came and gave us an award for the partnership when very likely we should be giving them an award for serving our people so well with optometry care all these many years,” Baker said. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

FORT SMITH, Ark. – The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes recently notified U.S. Marshals Museum officials in Fort Smith that it’s accepting the museum’s offer of property for a Trail of Tears monument at the planned museum’s site. --- In a Dec. 20 letter to Jim Dunn, Marshals Museum president and CEO, Muscogee (Creek) Nation Principal Chief and Inter-Tribal Council President George Tiger stated the council’s Executive Committee unanimously approved the offer. --- “This was a very generous and thoughtful gesture on behalf of the Museum Board to commemorate the tragic and historic events surrounding the removal of our ancestors to Indian Territory,” Tiger wrote. --- The Five Civilized Tribes are the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw and Seminole nations. --- The museum board first invited the tribes to place the monument in June 2011. While presenting the proposal to the board, Dunn noted that each of the tribes had passed through the Fort Smith area at least once during the Trail of Tears, and since then the U.S. Marshals and tribes have worked closely together. --- Under the proposal, the Marshals Museum will provide the tribes, at no cost, sufficient land for a monument or memorial, which should be of “world-class” quality. The tribes will cover the cost of constructing the monument. The ITC will have artistic control of the monument, subject to final approval by the museum board, and the ITC and board will establish appropriate committees to work out the details. --- Dunn said there is no timeline for the monument’s construction. He said he anticipates the committees will be formed this calendar year, and with museum construction expected to take 18 months, there is no immediate urgency to the monument’s construction. --- The monument will be at the northwest corner of the museum’s 6-acre property. --- The 50,260-square-foot Marshals Museum will be on the south end of the property, overlooking the Arkansas River, Dunn said. He said museum officials contemplate the Trail of Tears monument and the museum being connected by sidewalks and/or trails. --- As of December, $10.2 million has been raised toward the construction of the $50 million museum. --- The Trail of Tears was part of President Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Policy of the 1830s. Under the policy, thousands of American Indians were forced to migrate hundreds of miles from their southeastern United States homes across the Mississippi River to the newly designated Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma. Thousands of people died before and during the removals. In 1987, federal law authorized about 2,200 miles of trails as the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.

FORT GIBSON, Okla. – As part of a 4-H Club project, and to inform students about tribal government, Cherokee Nation citizen and former Little Miss Cherokee Cierra Fields organized the first Native Youth Summit, which was held Jan. 11 at Fort Gibson High School. --- Attendees learned about the tribal government and its three branches and how they work, CN elected officials’ responsibilities, concepts of stewardship and citizenship, how the tribe’s election process works, education, Native oral traditions and cancer awareness and prevention. --- “This is really cool stuff that people need to know and it would be really helpful in the future,” Fields, who attends Fort Gibson middle school, said. --- Speakers included Tribal Councilors Cara Cowan Watts, Lee Keener and Don Garvin; CN Secretary of State Charles Head; Miss Cherokee Christy Kingfisher; Junior Miss Cherokee Julie Thornton; CN storyteller Robert Lewis; CN College Resource Center Director Mandy Scott; and Fields, a melanoma cancer survivor who spoke about cancer prevention. CN citizen Regina Thompson also shared her story of being a survivor of melanoma. --- “They seemed like really cool people, and they all just seem to know so much and they have really important jobs in government so I thought it would be cool to have them there,” Fields, 13, said. --- Fields’ mother, Terri Henderson-Fields, said her daughter decided to go into tribal government after she worked for the National Congress of the American Indian for voting this past year. --- “And she held a voter rally in Fort Gibson, and then she got to talking with students at the rally and realized that none of them knew about their tribal government, let alone the federal government,” Henderson-Fields said. --- So for her 4-H Club project, Fields began organizing the youth summit. --- “4-H this year is now offering government and is allowing you to do tribal government and they’re also allowing the kids to have a project called cultural education,” Henderson-Fields said. “So Cierra is able to combine all of the stuff she does for Cherokee Nation and get credit for it through her 4-H program.” --- Fields’ goal with the summit was to empower students to effect change within their communities by good citizenship and leadership. --- “We thought it would be a neat way to start getting more Cherokee youth a little more involved in the political process so that by the time they turn 18, they’ll know how it runs and how they can change things,” Henderson-Fields said. --- More than 70, parents, 4-H Club members and students attended the event, which was open for students in grades sixth through 12th. --- “We opened it up to the public…because Cierra also thought it would be good to show the non-citizens the financial impact Cherokee Nation has on the community, and if our money was not here in this part of Oklahoma, look at all of these jobs that would not exist,” Henderson-Fields said. --- CN citizen and Fort Gibson freshman Blake Henson said he found the summit’s information helpful. --- “I really want to start an AISES (American Indian Science and Engineering Society) chapter at my Fort Gibson High School, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn about everything. But I also found it interesting how they talked about the government and cancer awareness,” he said. “I thought that was really helpful.” --- This year, the Native Youth Summit was only one day. However, in the future, Field said she hopes to make it into a two- or three-day event. --- “She has actually written a grant and we find out in March if she wins the grant. We’re shooting for a $1,000 grant, then this fall she will have a full-day summit,” Henderson-Fields said. “Her goal is, during her high school years, she would like to see this made into a two- or three-day conference and then invite all the tribal nations in the state of Oklahoma.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation’s Natural Resources Department is again offering Cherokee gardeners a chance to grow a bit of the tribe’s history and culture in their respective gardens using heirloom seeds from its seed bank. --- This year 13 seed varieties are being offered. The seeds are free, but participating gardeners are asked to help restock the seed bank by sending seeds from their crops to the tribe. --- “To me, that’s a really cool thing. It’s Cherokees helping Cherokees,” administration liaison Pat Gwin said. “As far as we know we are the only Indian tribe that grows our own heirloom seeds and distributes them to our own citizens, so that’s pretty cool too.” --- He said requests for seeds were down in 2012 because draught and the extreme heat during the summer of 2011 caused a difficult growing season. In 2012, about 2,500 seed packets were distributed. --- During the four years the seeds have been given away, the highest number of seed packets given during a year was 6,000, Gwin said. Some packets have been sent as far away as Nigeria, Africa. --- “But I really think by far the vast majority of them go to California and the Tennessee area,” he said. --- Gwin said the popularity of particular seeds varies annually, but White Eagle Corn and Native Tobacco seeds are always really popular. --- Because of the difficult past summer, crop yields were nominal. Subsequently some seed varieties are not available this year because growers were not been able to send back as many seeds. However, the seed bank maintains a genetic stock of seeds that do not get intermingled with seeds that are sent back to Natural Resources. --- “We’ve been able to supply some of the giveaway seeds because other parts of the country haven’t been as hot as here and people have sent us seeds we are able to send back out,” Gwin said. “They work really hard at this. A lot of people think they’re not doing enough to fulfill their end of the bargain if they don’t grow enough to send some back, so they’re always sending some back.” --- The heirloom seeds are for plants that have been researched and are historically related to the tribe. Seeds available this year include Georgia Candy Roaster Squash, Job’s Tears (beads) and Jewel and Dipper Gourds. Other species available include Cherokee Flour Corn, which is large flour corn that includes white, yellow and colored (multi-colored) varieties; Cherokee White Eagle Corn; the Trail of Tears bean (small, jet black bean); Cherokee Long Greasy bean; Turkey Gizzard bean; and Native Tobacco, which is a ceremonial tobacco. It’s not a smoking tobacco and is restricted to citizens at least 18 years old. --- Most of the seeds are rare cultivars not widely available through commercial means. --- For more information about the seed bank, call Mark Dunham at 918-453-5336 or visit the Natural Resources webpage at ---  www.cherokee.org . Seed requests can be emailed to ---  pat-gwin@cherokee.org or ---  mark-dunham@cherokee.org . --- Requests should include a name, scanned copy of CN citizenship card (blue card), a mailing address where the seeds should be sent, and if requesting tobacco seeds, proof of being at least 18. --- The CN has a limited supply of these seeds, and every request may not be granted. Recipients are limited to two seed varieties. Only one variety of corn and gourds may be requested due to hybridization issues, so recipients should include one or two alternate seed varieties. Also, alternate seed varieties should be chosen because there is a limited supply of certain species. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Tribal Councilor Cara Cowan Watts has been selected to serve on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Local Government Advisory Committee. Her term began on Nov. 15 and will run until Nov. 30, 2014. --- The LGAC provides advice and recommendations that assist the EPA in developing stronger partnerships with local governments through building state and local capacity to deliver environmental services and programs. Its ultimate goal is to provide the citizens with more efficient and effective environmental protection at the community, state and federal level. --- In a letter to Cowan Watts, the EPA stated her “experience and perspective are particularly valuable to the agency” as it explores ways in which national policy might affect state and local governments. --- “I accepted the nomination as it is an honor to be considered and incredibly important work on behalf of Indian Country and the Cherokee Nation,” Cowan Watts of Claremore said. “I want to raise awareness about the work being done in Indian Country and still needing to be done in Indian Country concerning our environment. Federal regulations impact on governments and specifically more localized governments such as tribes seems to be the main focus.” --- The LGAC is chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act and has been in existence since 1993. It is comprised primarily of elected and appointed local officials, along with several state representatives, environmental interest groups and labor interests. Committee members come from various regions around the country. --- She said the committee is scheduled to meet every three to four months across the United States, but meets primarily in Washington, D.C. --- “I believe my appointment will help the Cherokee people. As we continue to exercise our governmental obligations to protect our environment such as water and air quality, we are obligated to uphold the federal Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act same as the states around us,” she said.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Microsoft and Cherokee Nation officials celebrated the integration of the Cherokee language into the new Windows 8 operating system on Dec. 19 at Sequoyah High School. --- Cherokee is the first Native American language to be integrated into a Windows system. Sixteen CN language translators and other staff members worked with Microsoft to prepare for the integration of Cherokee into Windows 8. --- “On behalf of Microsoft, it’s our honor and pleasure to be here to announce the language interface pack officially available for the Cherokee language on the Windows 8 platform operating system,” Carla Hurd, Microsoft Local Language Program manager, said. “My hat goes off to all of the translators, all of the staff, all of the support that went into this huge effort. I think of this as just the beginning. We’ve already started on Office 2013, which is the next step. It’s an even bigger project. Microsoft products are everywhere, and your language will in turn be everywhere.” --- More than 20 years ago, Microsoft employee Tracy Monteith, an Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians citizen, asked the company to include his native language in the computer’s core operating system. It wasn’t until 2010 that CN language technologists met with Monteith and others at Microsoft to get the project going. --- A team of translators was assembled, ranging from tribal employees, community speakers and Cherokee college students. --- “It became a rewarding experience for me to know that in the future the language is going to be there. I’m just proud to be a part of this effort and being a translator for Microsoft. And I thank the Microsoft people for allowing us to do this,” CN translator Russell Feeling said. --- Lois Leach, a 56-year-old clerk in the Nation’s Roads Department, logged more than 100 volunteer hours during the past year translating computer terms that did not exist when the Cherokee language originated. --- “You don’t look at yourself really doing anything that huge until you see it come together,” Leach said. “It’s amazing to think our work will be shared all over the world.” --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker said Cherokee translators translated more than 180,000 words for the program and that this was the largest Cherokee translation project since the Bible was translated in the 1800s. --- “You have done great work, and you are truly heroes of the Cherokee Nation,” Baker said to the translators. --- He added that the integration of Cherokee into Windows 8 “will truly keep the language alive.” --- “For a people to lose their language is probably the most terrible thing that can befall a people,” he said. “We thank Microsoft for putting their great resources to use. They’ll never make any money off this project, we know that, but they’re going to help keep the Cherokee spirit, the Cherokee language alive forever.” --- In November, the tribe partnered with Google to add Cherokee to it email service Gmail. Cherokee speakers can now exchange emails using Gmail and instant message chats entirely in the Cherokee syllabary. --- In March 2011, Google added Cherokee as an interface language, meaning anyone who reads and writes Cherokee can look up virtually anything on the World Wide Web using the Cherokee language. --- In another effort to perpetuate the language, this past fall Cherokee translators dusted off the numeric system developed by Sequoyah, the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary. Translation Specialist John Ross from the CN Translation Department studied and figured out the numeric system in an effort to create a font to make it useful for printing and computers. --- Sequoyah created unique, single symbols for numbers 1 through 19 and numbers 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100. So to create the number 31, the symbol for 30 and 1 would be used together or to create the number 500 the symbol for 5 and 100 would be used together. Ross created a symbol for 0 and created symbols for 1 billion and 1 trillion. --- In 2010, the Unicode system was introduced for the Cherokee language. The numbering system associates numbers to language characters and creates a uniform system for writing and reading Cherokee on computers. --- “Unicode is the international standard for all computer technology now – cell phones, computers, video games…anything that’s digital uses Unicode to display languages,” Language Technologist Roy Boney said. --- A European group called the Unicode Consortium determines computer standards and a numbering system for languages. Language fonts receive their own numbering systems using the consortium’s standards. --- “Cherokee has been assigned a (number) code group by the Unicode Consortium. So it is standard across the world,” Boney said. --- In 2010, the Cherokee syllabary became available on iPhones and the iPod Touch after three years of developing software with Apple Inc. --- In 2009, Facebook added Cherokee to its popular social web site. Boney is one of 14 translators on Facebook who helps Cherokee people maintain cultural ties by allowing speakers registered on the site to translate a glossary of common Facebook words and phrases. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

NICUT, Okla. – The Bradley Ford Bridge over Little Lee Creek in northern Sequoyah County is once again passable again thanks to the Cherokee Nation’s Roads Program. --- The bridge’s south abutment washed out in April when heavy rains swept away dirt and rock surrounding the abutment, causing the south end of the bridge to collapse. --- “The water just got up so high and it started swirling and eating the earth on one end of the bridge. Literally, the bridge was hanging out in mid-air, sitting on top of beams that are driven down in the soil all the way to bedrock,” Roads Program Director Michael Lynn said. --- He said the road the bridge is a part of was already on the Roads Program’s construction list but not scheduled for work. The bridge’s collapse altered plans, however. --- “The county came to us after the abutment washed out, and we worked out a situation with them so that they could engineer and design the repair, which actually ended up being a bridge extension,” Lynn said. --- Paradigm Construction and Engineering, of Tulsa, was chosen to extend and repair the bridge with a bid of $860,000, which was paid by the Roads Program using federal Indian Reservation Roads funds the CN annually receives. --- “They went in and added an additional 80-foot span to the existing bridge,” Lynn said. --- The additional length gives the water a larger “throat” to flow through, which should prevent another washout from occurring. In 2000, support around the same abutment washed out, but the county was able refill the area and make repairs. --- Paradigm began repairing and extending the bridge in mid-May and finished in November. Tribal and county officials dedicated the new bridge span on Nov. 19. --- Lynn said residents had to take a 9-mile detour while the bridge was out, which was a “headache” for them. --- Dist. 3 Tribal Councilor Janelle Fullbright said while the bridge was out people were able to use a low-water bridge to cross Little Lee Creek, which at times was hazardous. --- She said people used the detour when water flowed over the low-water bridge and that a woman recently had to be rescued from it because she misjudged the depth of the creek flowing over the bridge and became stranded in her car. --- “People are happy the bridge is done,” Fullbright said. --- The Bradley Ford Bridge is also part of one of the bus routes used by Belfonte Schools in Sequoyah County. Belfonte now oversees the Bell School system in southern Adair County. Buses and staff from both schools use the bridge traveling back and forth between the schools. --- The Roads Program will next manage work on approximately five miles of the nearby Nicut South Road that ties in with the Kirk Mountain or Nicut North Road project. That project will take the road into the Nicut community. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

WASHINGTON – On Nov. 27, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Kevin K. Washburn announced final regulations that will streamline the leasing approval process on Native land, increasing homeownership and expediting business and commercial development, including renewable energy projects. --- “This reform will expand opportunities for individual landowners and tribal governments to generate investment and create jobs in their communities by bringing greater transparency and workability to the Bureau of Indian Affairs leasing process,” Salazar said. “This final step caps the most comprehensive reforms of Indian land leasing regulations in more than 50 years and will have a lasting impact on individuals and families who want to own a home or build a business on Indian land.” --- The comprehensive reform overhauls antiquated regulations governing the BIA’s process for approving the surface leases on lands the federal government holds in trust for Indian tribes and individuals. As trustee, the Interior manages about 56 million surface acres in Indian Country. --- “This reform is about supporting self-determination for Indian Nations and was developed in close consultation with tribal leaders,” Washburn said. “The streamlined, commonsense rule replaces a process ill-suited for economic development of Indian lands and provides flexibility and certainty to tribal communities and individuals regarding decisions on the use of their land.” --- The new rule helps to implement the recently passed Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership Act, which allows federally recognized tribes to assume greater control of leasing on tribal lands. --- The new regulation will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. The final rule provides clarity by identifying specific processes, with enforceable timeline, through which the BIA must review leases. --- The regulation also establishes separate, simplified processes for residential, business and renewable energy development rather than using a “one-size-fits-all” approach that treats a lease for a single family home the same as a lease for a large wind energy project. --- The new process provides a 30 day-limit for the BIA to issue decisions on residential leases, subleases and mortgages. For commercial or industrial development, the BIA would have 60-days to review leases and subleases. If the BIA does not complete its review of subleases in this timeframe, those agreements will automatically go into effect.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The movie “Cherokee Word for Water” was released to the public in late November in both Tulsa and Tahlequah. --- The movie is about Cherokees and non-Cherokees working together to build a waterline in the Cherokee community of Bell in the 1980s. --- According to Circle Cinema’s website, a nonprofit and independent movie theater in Tulsa, the film “focuses on the cultural assets of Native people and seeks to help reshape the public perception of Native people.” --- According to the Internet Movie Database website, the movie is told from the “perspective of Wilma Mankiller and full-blood Cherokee organizer Charlie Soap, who join forces to battle opposition and build a 16-mile waterline system using a community of volunteers.” --- At the film’s Nov. 20 opening at the Dream Theater in Tahlequah, cast members, as well as Charlie Soap, fielded questions and talked about the film before its showing. --- “One of the things that Wilma wanted this film to do was inspire people in the Native country about taking things into their own hands,” Soap said. “So this is what Wilma wanted to inspire people around the world that ‘you can do anything that you want to do if you just work together.’” --- Moses Brings Plenty plays Soap in the film. Brings Plenty is an Oglala Lakota television, film and stage actor and a traditional drummer and singer from the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. --- Brings Plenty said when he first heard about filming in Oklahoma he was surprised because he had only been through Oklahoma City and wondered where they’d be filming this kind of movie. --- “They said Tahlequah. I had never been to Tahlequah before. And I tell you what, I envy each and every one of you because this is some of the most beautiful country,” he said. “I told Charlie that you all have a beautiful place here and the people here…I felt like I was at home. And Tahlequah, you guys should be proud of what has been accomplished here.” --- He added that this film is not just about indigenous people or Indian people, but about love and compassion that can be seen in the film and it comes across in many ways. --- “This is about us as common people, as human beings, and we can make a lot of beautiful things happen when we all come together and support things that are positive,” Brings Plenty said. --- There are plans to release the movie across the United States and in cities and towns throughout Indian Country in 2013. After its theaters run, it will be distributed among retailers for purchase, including Wal-Mart. --- For more information about the movie, visit its Facebook page or the Wilma P.

TULSA, Okla. – Eight Cherokee Nation citizens will portray members of the Hominy Indians football team from the 1920s in the documentary “Playground of the Native Son,” which was expected to begin filming in December. --- All actors portraying football players held their first meeting and practice on Dec. 2 at Veteran’s Park. --- The movie is based on the story of the 1925 Hominy Indians professional football team and is a project of independent film producer Celia Xavier and Fully Funded Films. --- Overall, 13 Native Americans men got fitted for uniforms and met Xavier and coach Wade Weller (Caddo), who will teach the plays that will be used in the film. --- “We wanted to put the players in the positions and teach them the offense and defense plays that they ran back in that day and do a team fitting for the uniforms and get team pictures,” Weller said. ---  Of the 13 players on the Hominy Indians football team, eight are Cherokee. --- CN citizen Kiah Smith, who will portray one of the players, said he wrote a paper on Haskell football in the 1920s, which included the Hominy Indians story. --- “Anything positive that we can show our young Native kids how working together can make us successful is always good,” he said. --- CN citizen Johnny Murphy said he was interested in the movie because other than it featuring an “awesome story about Native Americans” he was excited about playing football again. --- “I’m ready to get on the field again. I know we will not actually be playing, but it’ll be pretty cool to suit up and what a great experience this will be,” he said. --- The team was expected to have dress rehearsal of the plays in mid-December with filming beginning later in the month. However, Xavier said they are still casting for the film. --- “We need a coach who will give the halftime speech in the movie,” Xavier said. “We also have a couple speaking parts that we need to cast and production assistants.” --- People interested in the movie for a part, whether speaking or as extras, need to visit the Facebook page at film’s Facebook page Hominy Indians Movie or ---  www.playgroundofthenativeson.com . --- According to a press release, the documentary has received an arts grant from the Osage Nation Foundation.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Chosen for her innovative early childhood dentistry program, Cherokee Nation Dr. Mechelle Speed is being featured in a national Indian Health Service video. --- “This is a very big honor for the Cherokee Nation,” Speed said. “We not only want to meet the standard, but we also want to set the standard.” --- The IHS office in Albuquerque, N.M., will highlight Speed and the popular fluoride varnish program she helped design. IHS officials hope featuring Speed’s program as a model for other tribes will shine a light on the importance of using fluoride varnish three to four times a year to diminish the cavity rate among young children. IHS officials said the CN’s cavity rate is lower than the national average for preschool-aged children as a result of Speed’s program. --- “Dr. Mechelle Speed has been working with the Head Start program for some time now. Her fluoride varnish program is one of the most successful in the nation, so we look at her work as a model for what other IHS and tribal programs can accomplish with their children,” Dr. Timothy L. Ricks, IHS co-chair for the Early Childhood Caries Collaborative, said. --- The video is one of four being produced by IHS and will be shown in IHS facilities nationwide. The three other videos feature other health concerns facing Native Americans and recommended treatments. --- Speed’s work to prevent childhood cavities also earned her recognition locally as the Child Advocate of the Year by the CN Early Childhood Unit. The group recognized her for her cavity prevention work with children in the CN Head Start program.

DENVER – The American Indian College Fund was recently awarded $100,000 from the USA Funds for marketing and scholarship support. --- “USA Funds has been a key partner in helping us to support Native scholarships, making the possibility of a college degree possible for people in our communities, where few can afford to attend college without financial assistance,” AICF President and CEO Dr. Cheryl Crazy Bull said. “We are grateful for their continued support and commitment to Indian education.” --- Half of the funds given to the AICF paid for sponsored marketing to create awareness about the AICF and raise scholarship support for Native students attending tribal colleges and universities across the country. --- An additional $50,000 of the funds were presented to benefit the Richard B. Williams-Seventh Generation Leadership Endowment Scholarship, which was established to honor a former AICF president and CEO. --- “The American Indian College Fund is committed to helping Native students achieve the dream of a postsecondary education,” USA Funds President and CEO Carl Dalstrom said. “That mission is in line with USA Funds' mission to enhance preparation for, access to and success in postsecondary education, specifically for low-income students, students of color, and students who are the first in their families to attend college.” --- For more information, visit ---  www.collegefund.org .

STILWELL, Okla. – Stilwell High School hosted a social stickball tournament on Nov. 9 to bring students from different Adair County middle schools together with hopes that they would form friendships before entering high school. --- “We have a different setup here in Adair County, and we have several K (kindergarten) through eight (eighth grade) schools, and they grow up playing against one another most of the time,” Stilwell Public Schools Superintendent Geri Gilstrap said. “So when they come into high school to be together, it’s difficult for them to bonds sometimes because they’ve grown up playing against one another. The more events that we can have to make them feel like we are a community and that we’re working together for the good of all, the better off we are.” --- Students from Bell, Rocky Mountain, Stilwell, Dahlonegah, Tenkiller, Cave Springs and Maryetta schools participated in the tournament. Teams were formed using students from each school so that schools weren’t playing other schools. Tours of SHS were also given so students could become more familiar it. --- SHS and Westville High School are the county’s only two high schools. --- “We’re really hoping to fill our freshman academy with children that want to be a Stilwell Indian and know that we care about each of them and that they’ve made relationships with these other students outside of competitive sports where they are friends and they can come in and be ready to go as a ninth grader and be ready to bond together,” Gilstrap said. --- Northeastern State University and University of Arkansas representatives also attended to encourage students to continue on to college after high school. --- “Some of the college students are my Cherokee Promise scholars and a few of them went to school here at Stilwell or at Dahlonegah or at Rocky Mountain or at some of the feeder schools who are here so they know what it’s like, and they said ‘yeah, this is a great idea, whatever they can do to help,’” Dr. Leslie Hannah, NSU director of Cherokee programs, said. --- Cherokee Promise scholars are low-income Cherokee students pursuing higher education at NSU who live in a designated residence hall with large spacious rooms on an all-Cherokee floor. They are provided, throughout their time in the program, with different Cherokee cultural activities, specialized classes and other opportunities designed to fit their needs. --- The idea for the tournament came together when Hannah and SHS faculty wanted to get Adair County middle school students more acquainted with the high school’s system. --- “Anything we can do in the future like this to get these kids together, we’re hoping to do more,” Gilstrap said. --- The SHS Indian Heritage Club, whose members frequently play stickball, helped with setting up the poles, organization and sharing some of the Cherokee culture. --- “I’m with the Indian Heritage Club and we’re putting on this to get all of the schools together to learn about culture and the Cherokee language,” Heath Bunch, SHS senior and United Keetoowah Band citizen, said. --- During the tournament, students also got the chance to learn how stickball sticks are made. --- “There aren’t very many people who know about their culture anymore so we’re just trying to get everybody together so we can kind of, regroup the culture so we can be a proud Nation once again,” he said. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

PARK HILL, Okla. – Cherokee Heritage Center officials announced Diligwa as the name of the new outdoor living exhibit during an Oct. 25 ceremony at the center. --- Diligwa, currently under construction at the center, will replace the Tsa-La-Gi Ancient Village in May. When the village opened in 1967, it was designed as an interpretive area to showcase Cherokee life prior to European contact. --- “This marks another historic milestone for the heritage center and the Cherokee National Historical Society. Just one year ago, we began the construction phase of the new outdoor exhibit. This exhibit will give visitors a chance to experience Cherokee life in the early 18th century,” Barbara Girty, CHC interim deputy executive director, said. “What’s now presented in the Ancient Village is limited by the research and resources that were available in its day. Diligwa will be the most authentic Cherokee experience based on life in the early 1700s.” --- The name is a derivative of Tellico, a village in the east that was once the principal Cherokee town and capital but is now under water. Tellico was the center of commerce before the emergence of Echota in what is now Monroe County, Tenn., and was often referred to as the “wild rice place.” It became synonymous with a native grain that grew in the flat open spaces of east Tennessee. --- Many people believe when the Cherokees arrived in Indian Territory, the native grasses growing in the open spaces around the foothills of the Ozarks reminded them of the grassy open areas of Tellico. They called their new home Di li gwa, Tah-le-quah or Teh-li-co, “the open place where the grass grows.” --- CNHS board member Mary Ellen Meredith said Diligwa would give visitors the chance to see how Cherokee people lived pre-contact. She said there’s good archeological evidence from the early 18th century of how they lived that has been used for the new exhibit. --- “If you compare our houses to those of Europe and the rest of the world, we were no slouches. We didn’t build castles, but we built decent housing, so it will be wonderful for people to drive by and see who we are and what we’re doing,” she said. --- The new exhibit is estimated at $1.2 million and is funded by endowments from the Tom J. and Edna Mae Carson Foundation, Mary K. Chapman Foundation, Boyd Group and Meredith. --- The project was implemented in three phases. Phase 1 focused on planning and design and ran from February 2007 to December 2010. Phase 2 focused on landscaping and site preparation and ran from January to July 2011. Phase 3 focuses on project implementation and runs from October 2011 to May 2013. --- The new exhibit will feature 19 wattle and daub structures, 14 interpretive stations and a historic landscape set on four acres adjacent to the CHC. Visitors can witness daily Cherokee life as they are guided through the interpretive stations where crafts are demonstrated, stories are told and life ways are explained. --- The overall village includes eight residential sites, each with a summer and winter house, a corncrib, a “kitchen garden” and additional landscaping. The public complex consists of the primary council house and summer council pavilion overlooking a plaza that served as the center of community activity. In addition, two recreation areas featuring marble and stickball fields will showcase the Cherokee games still played today. The village will be anchored with native foliage and flora common to the southeastern United States, with a recirculating stream flowing across its eastern area. --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker reminded people at the naming ceremony that the CHC and the Ancient Village was conceived and built through the efforts of Tahlequah resident Col. Martin Hagerstrand in 1963 without the benefit of recent archeological knowledge of how 18th century Cherokee people lived. --- Baker said he appreciates the authenticity of the new outdoor exhibit. --- “It is so wonderful that through archeological studies and paintings from contact (with white settlers) that we have been able to recreate something that is more realistic, something that truly shows our culture, our heritage, our history and where we came from,” he said. --- For more information, visit ---  www.CherokeeHeritage.org . ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

CATOOSA, Okla. – The Cherokee National Historical Society honored three men for their contributions to preserving, promoting and teaching the Cherokee history and culture during the society’s SevenStar Gala on Oct. 20 at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa. --- Cherokee Heritage Center archivist Tom Mooney was given the society’s Stalwart Award, which is given to one who has served as a “long-time member, volunteer, employee, board member or associate and has significantly contributed” to the CHC’s success. --- Mooney said he’s worked for the CHC for 36 years and being recognized was “amazing” considering the people who have received the award in the past. --- “Oh gosh, I couldn’t believe it happened,” he said. “I think John Ketcher was a recipient last year and anything John did, I can’t follow in his footsteps at all. But you know to have validation from the board that they appreciate my service means a lot to me…It was such a surprise.” --- CNHS officials said when Mooney began working as an archivist, the collection was contained in a filing cabinet with four drawers and consisted of letters and photographs. Now the archives contain much more and fill two rooms. --- Architect Charles “Chief” Boyd received the Contemporary Achievement Award, which recognizes a Cherokee who is extremely accomplished in his or her chosen field and has brought honor to the tribe. --- Boyd is the architect who designed the Tsa La Gi Amphitheater, the Cherokee Heritage Center building and the original Ancient Village. Boyd said he’s been involved with the CNHS for 50 years and being recognized by one’s own tribe is an honor. --- “I’m still very passionate about the historical society…which has been around longer (than the tribe) with the primary purpose of preserving the culture and the heritage of the tribe,” he said. “And it’s fun to make that happen or try and make that happen.” --- Cherokee Nation school/community specialist Robert Lewis received the Tradition Bearer Award, which is presented to one who has preserved Cherokee traditions through crafts, history or storytelling. --- Lewis said his first story about the creation of the Milky Way was heard from his father on a family trip. After that, he said, storytelling was buried deep within him. --- He said he was chosen for the award because of the storytelling he does within schools, communities and his many years of work as a tour guide and storyteller for the CHC. --- Lewis said he is “extremely humbled” that he was chosen for the award. --- “To me (this award) represents all the villagers,” he said. “I think it’s a reflection from all the people I’ve worked with including all the National Treasures and traditionalists who worked out there (CHC).” --- The CNHS formed in 1963 by a group of CN citizens who “shared a desire to establish a permanent culture-keeping institution for the Cherokee people.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

BY KEVIN SCRAPPER --- Reporter --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Historically, the American dream involves homeownership and financial security. However, for many, this is becoming harder to achieve and for those with low credit scores it is nearly impossible. Luckily, the Cherokee Nation’s Self-Sufficiency Program offers credit coaching to help its citizens reach financial stability and self-sufficiency. --- Financial coach Terry Crow said financial challenges can be as different as the people who experience them, so she adapts the program’s teaching material to fit each client’s need. --- “We tailor it to the areas and the places we go. When you go out and try to talk to people, they look at it as a double negative because, most of the time, their credit is not something they want to deal with and it’s hopeless,” she said. “It’s like, ‘you’re just going to tell me my credit’s bad and I can’t afford to fix it,’ but the thing is credit is a way of life and it’s showing them hope. If they’re in the negative, you may not be able to work on your credit yet, but let’s get you out of the negative, then, let’s start on it. We’re here with you to walk you through it.” --- Crow’s instruction focuses on more than functional budget consultation, extending to nurture the spirit of clients through compassionate understanding. She said she’s experienced financial hardship and reiterates that financial challenges emerge for everyone, but the attitude and strategy with which someone approaches the situation determine the outcome. --- “My main thing is to help people understand that nobody’s perfect and we live in an economy and society where it’s all about the score,” Crow said. “It’s all about credit and money, and if you feel like your credit is an issue then you kind of walk around with your head hung down and you feel like there’s no help. Even if you’re in risk of foreclosure, we do foreclosure prevention. Don’t feel like you’re alone, because there are people here, that care, that want to help.” --- Self-Sufficiency Counselor Rita Whaler agrees with Crow and applies the same approach. --- She said trends in the program emphasize awareness and empowerment of the client in creating financial freedom and stability that fits with their budget specific needs. --- “Credit coaching is counseling with people, making them aware of their spending, letting them realize that there is a way to control their spending, watching them track their spending over a period of time, (and) putting them on a livable doable budget,” she said. “You know everyone’s budgets are different, because everyone’s spending, incomes and lifestyles are different. You have to put on different hats with each client, because everyone is different.” --- Because credit and finances are sensitive subjects, Whaler reassures clients that their financial information obtained during the counseling sessions remain confidential. She also said there is no time limit on sessions or predetermined number of sessions a client must attend. She said the goal isn’t met until the client is set on their path to self-sufficiency. --- In addition to the individual credit counseling, the program offers instruction on saving and spending, as well as couponing and creative Christmas budgeting. Classes range from 30 minutes to two hours and vary by location. --- CN citizen Jerry Freeman said he’s participated in the savings and spending classes and that they helped him get a control on his finances. --- “I got started in March. It’s had a big impact,” said Freeman. “It’s taught me how to save money. It’s taught me how to budget my money. Its taught me not be scared to take that big step into homeownership and they’ve got a lot of good programs. I’m really excited about it.” --- With his finances in check, he said he looks forward to owning a home again, this time more informed. --- “About four years ago, I did own a home. We got into a little situation where we had to refinance. Well going through that refinancing, there were a lot of things I didn’t see,” he said. “They ended up jacking our house payment up so high that we couldn’t afford it. So I had to file bankruptcy and the whole mess that incurs. I’m ready to do the homeownership now. With this program, I know I can’t fail.” --- For more information, call 918-453-5336 or email ---  sbac@cherokee.org . ---  kevin-scrapper@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000 ext. 5903 ---  Self-Sufficiency Services ---  Mortgage Assistance Program --- Not only can Cherokee Nation citizens build and repair their credit and reach personal financial goals, but with the Mortgage Assistance Program, qualified citizens can also get down payment assistance up to $15,000. ---  Homebuyers Education --- The Homebuyers Education course helps CN citizens learn how to shop for a home, understand mortgages, credit reports and foreclosure prevention.

TULSA, Okla. – The newly formed League of Women Voters of the Cherokee Nation plans to be active in the upcoming CN election and is looking for members to help with the group’s efforts. --- Cheryl Nichols Brown, a co-leader of the league, said CN citizens started the group this past summer because they wanted to assist the tribe and Cherokee voters. --- “The League of Women Voters is non-discriminatory. Anybody can join, including men, and we do have some members who are male,” she said. “We are non-partisan. We encourage Cherokee citizens to join us because that’s what we want.” --- To get started, the group sought help from the League of Women Voters of Metropolitan Tulsa. Since then the national League of Women Voters office has approved the Cherokee league. --- “From what I understand we are the first tribal unit of the League of Women Voters,” Brown said. We’ve had a very good reception from the public. We expect a lot of good to come out this and a lot of positive things.” --- Currently, the league has approximately 35 members with a majority of them being CN citizens. The rest are spouses of tribal citizens. Membership is scattered throughout the CN, Brown said, which makes the league different from others. The group stays in touch through emails and social media. --- Because the league’s membership is scattered, Brown said the group’s meetings will be held at alternate locations each time to give members an opportunity to attend in person. --- Brown said she tries to keep members informed of opportunities to set up voter registration booths at area events and community meetings. --- “This is kind of a learning process for us. The League of Women Voters of Metropolitan Tulsa is mentoring us during this time. They are trying to help us learn the ropes as to what should we be doing,” she said. “At this time, the most important thing for us is registering Cherokee voters and trying to update voter information because we have 14,000 plus bad addresses out there.” --- Voters with “bad addresses” are those whose current addresses are unknown to the tribe and its Election Commission. --- Brown added that added another important task is the hold candidates accountable to CN citizens. --- In the coming months, the league will be involved with the 2013 tribal election and is going to share information about the tribe’s voting process because it is “slightly confusing,” Brown said. --- “For example, when election time comes, we would like to host candidate and issue forums. We’d like to write candidate questionnaires and distribute those questionnaires to the candidates and then publish the findings to the voters,” she said. “We’re trying to make certain a member of our group is always at the Election Commission meetings so we’ll know firsthand what is being discussed and what is going on.” --- League members also attend Tribal Council committee meetings to stay abreast of legislation being discussed and approved. Brown said the league would research legislation and issues affecting CN citizens and share the results with them. --- “There’s a lot going on in our tribe right now, and we’re trying to make certain we’re informed,” she said. --- “There was quite a bit of confusion last year with the elections and such, and we were just trying to think what can we do as private citizens. I think sometimes voters don’t know where they have to turn if they feel like they’ve had an issue with voting, and so protecting the voters’ legal rights within the laws of the Cherokee Nation is another objective of ours.” --- For more information, call Brown at 918-441-3905 or email Cherokee4Cherokees@gmail.com. --- People can join the LWVCN by visiting the League of Women Voters of Metropolitan Tulsa website at ---  http://lwvtulsa.org . When joining through the Tulsa league website, put in the notes section “Cherokee Unit” so that memberships will be placed with the CN league. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The U.S. Justice Department has awarded the Cherokee Nation more than $1.4 million in grant money to enhance law enforcement practices, which means 10 new patrol vehicles for the tribe’s Marshal Service. --- According to a press release, the grants were part of more than $100 million given to tribes to enhance law enforcement practices, and sustain crime prevention and intervention efforts in 10 areas, including public safety and community policing, alcohol and substance abuse, violence against women and elder abuse. --- Slightly less than $1 million will go to Marshal Service for five new Ford Interceptors and five new Dodge Chargers with radio and police packages for the use of safety and patrol. --- Suzanne Drywater, the Marshal Service’s manager of Administrative Operations, said the Justice Department’s Community Oriented Policing Services or COPS advances the practice of community policing in America’s state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies. --- She added that COPS made 64 awards in the amount of $26.9 million to tribal communities to support the hiring and equipment needs of tribal jurisdictions. The Marshal Service received a $999,972 Tribal Resources Grant Program award for equipment and training for a three-year period, Drywater said. --- Jennifer Kirby, CN Human Services assistant manager, said nearly $500,000 of the $1.4 million the tribe received would go to the Bright Futures Truancy Program in Adair County. --- “The grant Human Services received is from the Department of Justice. It is for $496,916 for three years,” she said. “The Cherokee Nation program will implement an in-home intervention program targeting Native American youths ages 5 to 17 who reside in Adair County and their families.” --- Kirby said the goal is to keep truant youths in school and prevent them from entering the juvenile justice system the first time, but also prevent re-offenders. --- “…Intervene with status offenders as early as possible and hold not just the juvenile accountable, but also the parents,” she said. “By providing intensive in-home skill building and educational services to these youth and families, the tribe hopes to keep the youth in their home community as productive, contributing citizens. This project will provide a wide array of services individualized for each family. Youth will be identified by the school through their low or declining school attendance.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

CLAREMORE, Okla. – On Oct. 1, the Claremore City Council voted to support an agreement with the Cherokee Nation and U.S. marshal services that allows city officers to provide protection or respond to calls occurring at facilities owned by the federal government or the tribe. --- According to the Claremore Daily Progress, previously, the Claremore police had limited legal authority at multiple locations within the city limits that are owned by the tribe and federal government, said Claremore Police Chief Stan Brown. --- “My primary concern and goal is to get cross deputation to provide protection against tort claims,” he said. --- The department has been fortunate in the past when working at these locations in the city, Brown added. --- “This is the best way for us to get authority to provide service to those properties,” he said. --- Brown also said there are benefits beyond the tort claim protection because the agreements gives the city the ability to call for assistance from the other agencies if needed. --- The agreements and deputation will provide critical coverage and response to those areas, he said.

BY KEVIN SCRAPPER --- Reporter --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Aspiring Cherokee athletes have a shining star to emulate in Angel Goodrich, a senior guard for the University of Kansas Lady Jayhawks and preseason candidate for the prestigious State Farm Wade Trophy. --- The trophy is presented annually to the best women’s basketball player in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I and named after three–time national champion Delta State University coach Lily Margaret Wade. --- Goodrich, a Cherokee Nation citizen, is one of 25 athletes on the list, but said awards and records aren’t the only rewards her collegiate basketball experience has provided her. --- “You always get these stereotypes about how Natives can’t do or won’t go that far, or they go to college and they drop out,” she said. “I’ve had a lot of young ones come up to me or even parents say ‘I’ve got a little girl who looks up to you,’ or some of them will say that they’ve gotten into sports from watching me play. It’s a great feeling to hear that from parents or little kids.” --- Goodrich holds the Kansas and Big 12 record for assists in one season. However, her road to records and accomplishments hasn’t been paved with easy times. --- She’s had to overcome adversity in numerous ways and from numerous sources. But she attributes her positive attitude and drive, as well as her family’s influence, as a large part of why she’s been able to succeed. --- “All my life, I’ve had people try to shut me down by telling me you’re too short to do this or too short to do that, or you’re not going to make it. With the people around me, with my family and my closest friends, they kept me up,” Goodrich said. “Just having them there and having them push me, it helped me stay positive. There’s going to be people that are going to try to put you down or going to try and do whatever to keep you from going to where you want to be, and you can’t let that happen to you. My parents have taught me to keep fighting, to keep pushing.” --- Beyond the social and mental obstacles Goodrich has had to overcome are her physical trials. In 2010, Goodrich suffered her second anterior cruciate ligament tear. The ACL is one of four major ligaments in the knee. Surgery is not always required, but in Goodrich’s case, it was. Goodrich was required to undergo months of physical rehabilitation to restore her full range of motion and strengthening of supporting muscles of the knee. With the experience behind her, Goodrich said the struggle only made her stronger. --- “With the ACL stuff, it was an obstacle for me, I got through and I’ve got a story now,” she said. “Since that happened to me, it’s only made me stronger. That’s what’s built my personality.” --- Having her name placed on the Wade’s preseason watch list hasn’t escaped Goodrich. She said she recognizes the adversity that she’s overcome and that her achievements speak of her personal fortitude, drive and determination. Goodrich said it’s an honor to be included on the list with other incredible players. --- “It means a lot. For me to just be on the watch list is an accomplishment,” she said. “It’s a great honor to be on a list that has the top players in the nation. I’ve worked hard for something like that and it’s came true.” ---  kevin-scrapper@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000 ext. 5903

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – In recognition of Alcohol and Drug Recovery Month, the Cherokee Nation has announced new Alcoholics Anonymous meetings available from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Wednesdays at 118 B Keetoowah St. --- Sherry Baker, first lady of the Cherokee Nation, initiated the new AA meetings. She said she recognized a need for an alcohol recovery group that Native Americans would feel comfortable attending. --- “This project is near and dear to my heart. I have seen alcoholism affect friends, family and community members over the years,” Baker said. “All of us are touched, either directly or indirectly, by its devastation, but people can recover if they have help and support, and that’s what we want to offer them at these meetings.” --- According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 12 percent of deaths among Native Americans and Alaska Natives between 2001-05 were alcohol related. Many people battling the disease turn to AA because it is an anonymous, judgment-free way to seek fellowship and recovery. --- Baker said mostly Cherokee volunteers run the facility and they hope to expand services offered at the location to include more AA meetings and recovery programs. --- The meetings are open to the public and anonymous. For more information, call Sam Bradshaw at 918-207-5538. To learn more about Alcoholics Anonymous visit ---  www.AA.org .

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Indian Health Services has acknowledged Cherokee Nation Health Services employee Linda Squirrel for her contributions by giving her the Trauma and Emergency Care, Emergency Medical Services and Injury Prevention for Native Americans Contribution Award. --- “(Linda’s) important and sustained contribution has been most helpful in establishing the Trauma Care and Injury Prevention Program we have today,” David Boyd, IHS National Trauma Systems coordinator, said. “She recognized a real clinical problem or system deficiency and through a process of conceptualization, creativity, adaptability and hard work brought forth a nuance not yet seen or experienced in Indian Country.” --- Squirrel started her career at CN 33 years ago, spending the majority of her time working in EMS. She helped initiate and establish tribal EMS organizations in Oklahoma and nationwide and has served on numerous boards and committees to promote tribal EMS. Most recently she served on the U.S. Department of Transportation National EMS Advisory Council representing more than 80 tribal EMS programs across the nation. --- “I have always been adamant about promoting tribal EMS and injury prevention,” she said. “I have received several awards and recognitions over the years, but this recognition is very significant for me because it is from Dr. Boyd.”

CATOOSA, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation contributed to the budgets of 127 rural volunteer fire departments on Sept. 18 by handing over checks totaling nearly a half million dollars. --- In addition to receiving the funds, the fire departments were also treated to a banquet at Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa, where the CN gave firefighters and departments awards. --- “These men and women are highly trained and skilled and are on call 24/7, 365 days a year, to protect our families. We just want to recognize and thank them for those services,” Principal Chief Bill John Baker said. “What they do is so important, and this is a way to help them continue to keep our areas safe.” --- This summer was one of Oklahoma’s driest summers on record, leading to a string of wildfires. Volunteer fire departments rely heavily on fundraisers and membership drives to pay for fuel, equipment and other expenses. Each of the 127 fire departments received a $3,582 check to help cover those costs. --- The Sallisaw Brushy Mountain Volunteer Fire Department was named the tribe’s Volunteer Fire Department of the Year for the southern region. Its crew of one paramedic, two ambulance drivers, seven first responders and four certified swift water rescue divers responded to 26 structure fires and salvaged all but three. --- “They not only helped put fires out in the neighborhood and volunteered to find missing hunters and children, but they also ran concession stands at school festivals and donated to buy them playground equipment,” said Deputy Chief Joe Crittenden, who emceed the dinner and awards. --- The Afton Volunteer Fire Department was nominated by the town’s mayor for donating more than 1,150 volunteer hours won Volunteer Fire Department of the Year for the tribe’s northern region. --- Volunteer Firefighter of the Year awards were also given to Rod Windle of Bluejacket, Cherie Brave of Hulbert, Nick Scott of Checotah and Scott O’Neal of Stilwell.

CATOOSA, Okla. – Cherokee Nation Businesses officials have decided to demolish the Cherokee Inn motel that sits near the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa, saying it’s no longer cost feasible to operate it. --- “We made the decision when we first bought that property that in some point in the future that that inn would come down and that we would convert that into additional parking spaces,” CNB interim CEO Shawn Slaton said. --- He said a business analysis showed that it was time to eliminate the motel for the extra parking. --- “The inn needed major renovations to the rooms and things to bring it back up to a high standards that we have, and we just felt like it was better for the business and for the company to go ahead at this time and do the demolition,” Slaton said. --- When Cherokee Nation Entertainment purchased the motel in 2006, some minor repairs were made to the 113-room facility. However, Slaton said he didn’t know when the inn was last renovated. He added that the business analysis did not give a price on renovating the motel. --- Slaton said people who stay at the Cherokee Inn have other options such as the La Quinta and Hampton inns, which neighbor the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino. He added that there will soon be 100 additional rooms inside the Hard Rock Hotel for a total of 456 rooms and that it would not be feasible to spend money to renovate the Cherokee Inn. --- “With the addition of the 100 suites in our new tower, plus two new hotels at a similar price point within walking distance, the business case determined it was time to move forward with the plan to create much-needed additional parking,” Slaton said. --- Currently, the Cherokee Inn has five employees who will be able to transfer to other positions within the Hard Rock when the inn closes, he said. --- Slaton said a bid would go out before November to determine costs for demolishing the inn. --- “We’ll put that out to bid and whoever is the successful bidder will determine that,” he said. --- As of press time, officials had not set a demolition date. --- Slaton said CNE purchased the motel for $2.8 million when it was part of the Super 8 Motel chain. According CNB documents, the Cherokee Inn is part of Cherokee Hotels LLC, a tribal limited liability company within CNE that owns and operates the inn and a hotel in Roland. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

BY KEVIN SCRAPPER --- Reporter --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Along with being capable of carrying 45 pounds for miles at a time, Cherokee Fire Dancers must possess mental toughness to face dangerous conditions as well as selflessness to help people they don’t know. --- Besides those attributes, Oklahoma Native American Fire Program Manager Teresa Williamson said there are other characteristics a successful Fire Dancer must possess. --- “Personal qualifications should include a willingness to work hard, be responsible and dependable, be courteous and professional, always try to be the best you can be and do things to make the people at home proud,” she said. --- And it’s those characteristics that have helped Fire Dancers suppress wildfires across the United States since 1988, including two wildfires in 2012. --- Fire Dancers must subsist in remote areas for up to two weeks and perform for 10 to 16 hours per day under hot, dusty and smoky conditions. But for Fire Dancer Lee Wolf, the rewards outweigh the risks. --- “You want to see what you can do to help put it (fire) out,” he said. --- And thought he enjoys being a Fire Dancer now, in the beginning he was hesitant. --- “My cousins and my little brother talked me into it. They probably did it a couple of years before I decided to get into it,” Wolf said. “You have somebody with you or someone that you know. We just help each other out.” --- Williamson said Fire Dancers work in two-week stints when other federal and state firefighting resources are exhausted, and there is no limit to the number of times a team or individual can be called to duty. --- She added that Fire Dancers take more away from the program than just paychecks. They learn skills, travel to different states, gain experiences and receive advancement opportunities. --- “Training is provided all year throughout the nation, if they choose to enhance their current qualifications and increase their hourly wage,” Williamson said. “They can receive up to 80 hours of pay to attend training each year.” --- Increased skills and training are bonuses in the Fire Dancers program because the job is considered seasonal employment. Williamson said Fire Dancers use their learned skills and earned certifications to pursue employment with other fire agencies. --- “They gain a lot of skills by being a wild land firefighter,” she said. “This enables them to apply for permanent and seasonal positions with any federal or state agency as a fire hire. They can also use their experience and education to be on the local volunteer fire departments and provide assistance to their communities.” --- Unfortunately, Fire Dancers often have to decide between keeping a steady job and reporting for firefighting duty. But Wolf said the choice is easy. --- “Some jobs won’t let you go out,” he said. “You just tell your boss that you’re going out anyway. Sometimes they say you won’t have a job when you get back, but you tell them you need that money.” --- Wolf said the money he receives for the average two-week Fire Dancer assignment is definitely worth his time and effort, but it’s the thrill and excitement that draw him to the job. --- “It gives you some adrenaline and you want to be out there every day,” he said. --- For more information about the Fire Dancers, call 918-453-5334 or visit ---  www.cherokeetero.com . ---  kevin-scrapper@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000 ext. 5903

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Of all the events offered at this year’s Cherokee National Holiday, the fishing derby is a favorite among children. --- Fishing Derby Coordinator Valerie Diffee said the event tries to encourage outdoor activity among children by hosting two age groups, 4-8 and 9-13. --- “It’s just kind of an event for the kids to get out and get away from the TV, video games and computers and actually do something,” Diffee said. “This is a great event for the kids. It’s early enough that it’s not too hot for them and they have a great time.” --- Each child had the opportunity to catch several types of fish, including catfish, crappie and bass, during the event and volunteers helped by weighing catches as they where reeled in by the young contestants. --- Throughout the event, door prizes were given in drawings to participating children along with prizes in three categories, including “most fish caught” and “biggest fish.” --- “We have the smallest, the biggest and the most fish caught in both age brackets and throughout the two hours that they fish we call out door prizes,” Diffee said. “And it’s fun for them. They get tents, sleeping bags and they get fishing poles.” --- Cherokee Nation citizen Trisda Teehee, 6, who attends Dahlonegah School in Adair County, was among the many kids catching fish. She caught the biggest fish in her age category, a catfish weight 1.85 pounds. --- “It was fun reeling it in and it was heavy,” she said. “(I won) a fishing pole, sleeping bag and $30.” --- Teehee said she took her family out for tacos with her winnings after the derby. --- “I was just excited to catch that big fish,” she said. --- CN citizen Grayci Spradlin, 5, who attends Peggs School in Cherokee County, caught the most fish in her category, catching nine fish. --- “I caught a bunch and won a fishing pole and sleeping bag and money,” Spradlin said. “I am going to save my money for a doll for my friend Ally cause her birthday is coming up.” --- Although the event’s participant numbers were lower compared to 2011, there were still more than 240 kids who tested their fishing skills. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560 ---  Ages 4-8: --- Most fish: Grayci Spradlin, --- Biggest fish: Trisda Teehee, --- Smallest fish: Valerie Ray, ---  Ages 9-13: --- Most fish: Caleb Luejthe, --- Biggest fish: Augustino Perez, --- Smallest fish: Ashlynn Barnoski

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – More than 120 years ago, the Cherokee Nation built a school of higher education for Native American students, a building that still stands today. --- The Cherokee National Female Seminary sits on the Northeastern State University campus, now called Seminary Hall, where thousands of students have classes each year. To help continue the history of the building, the CN offers free tours of Seminary Hall annually during the Cherokee National Holiday. --- “I find this very interesting work and I can tell that the people have an interest in it, and I’m glad to share that history with them,” C.H. Parker, Seminary Hall tour guide, said. “We’re very proud of it.” --- Parker started giving Seminary Hall tours during the holiday about 15 years ago. --- It was on May 7, 1889, when the female seminary reopened north of Tahlequah after fire destroyed it two years before. The first seminary opened in 1851 at Park Hill, only 12 years after the Cherokee people were removed from their homes in the southeastern United States to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. --- There was also a male seminary, which burned down in 1910 and never rebuilt. --- The Cherokee National Female Seminary was the first higher learning institution for women west of the Mississippi. It continued until 1909 when the state purchased the building. --- Today, NSU has representatives from about 39 Native American tribes attending the university, which is the highest in the United States, Parker said. --- The tour starts outside in front of Seminary Hall where a statue of Sequoyah sits as Parker explains how Sequoyah created the Cherokee syllabary. He also explains the structure of Seminary Hall. --- “There were so many different things, but I liked looking at the artworks, the paintings here and looking at the Sequoyah statue and hearing the history of him about his work,” said Linda Reedy. --- Reedy, who has lived in Tahlequah for four years, took her first tour of Seminary Hall this year. --- The tour moves inside where several photos were displayed showing a history of families and students who attended the school. --- “I like to do it because I’m very surprised at the number of people that really don’t have an understanding of how the Cherokee got here,” Parker said. “They’ve heard of the Trail of Tears but did not know about life in the southeastern part of the country that was their original homelands and also to make aware of the high quality education that the girls received here, the boys at the male seminary received and that we continued that quality in the legacy of all the students we have graduating now. We have the same standards. We have a connection that goes back to 1845 when the original council said we want to build schools for higher education for Indian students.” --- Once inside those on the tour are guided through the first floor to a classroom where Parker explains the history of the Cherokees before and after the Trail of Tears, leading up to how the seminary was created. --- “I thought it was good that he gave a history of not just the building but of the Cherokee Nation,” Reedy said. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

FORT GIBSON, Okla. – Explorer Dale Stewart finished retracing the Cherokee Trail of Tears water route on Aug. 17 where Cherokee people and other tribes’ people landed in the 1830s during forced removals. --- Stewart, 59, of Ashville, N.C., left Ross’s Landing in Chattanooga, Tenn., on June 18 in a custom-built canack – part canoe, part kayak. He said he traveled 1,226 miles on the Tennessee, Ohio, Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers. --- “When I started looking and found the water route I found not a lot had been written on it and a lot of people didn’t know anything about it. I said here’s an opportunity to educate people,” he said. “It’s been one hell of a journey. I’ve learned a lot. I stopped at a lot of historic sites all along the way.” --- He said in Savannah, Tenn., he was shown artifacts dealing with the removal of Cherokee people that had never been seen. One artifact was a receipt signed by Chief John Ross in 1839 that shows he bought firewood, corn and cornmeal. Ross had bought the steamboat Victoria to transport his family along the water route and had stopped at Savannah to stay with family. --- Also in Savannah, Stewart was shown a letter Ross wrote to the hosting family thanking them for their hospitality. The letter also informed the family of the death of Ross’s wife Quatie in Arkansas during the Ross’ travel. --- At least four detachments of Cherokees took the water in 1838-39. Stewart followed the Arkansas to Fort Gibson, just east of Muskogee, where members of the Arkansas Trail of Tears Association and the Cherokee Heritage Center greeted him. --- “I heard a lot of people say, ‘why did you this?’ The idea was to educate people…the Trail of Tears was the most terrible time, I think, in American history. However, the story I’m really wanting to tell is the resilience of the Cherokee and the other tribes, but especially the Cherokee,” he said. “I think people need to be reminded of the Trail of Tears every so often.” --- A film crew followed Stewart on his journey, and he said a documentary will be made of his trip and its purpose. He is also writing a book about his trip titled “Four Rivers.” --- Stewart also used the journey to raise funds for the Cherokee Children’s Home in Cherokee, N.C., His trip was supported by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Principal Chief Michell Hicks, who called Stewart a “friend” to the EBCI. --- Stewart is an explorer, adventurist, conservationist and educator. He said his exploration philosophy is to immerse himself in extreme and often hostile environments, which he has done on four continents, going alone and learning from indigenous people. --- This is the first “big expedition” he has done in the United States. He said compared to trips he has made in other countries this trip was fairly easy because he had easy access to supplies and the ability to stay in regular contact with friends and family. He said during the 64-day trip he camped 61 nights in his tent. --- “It was just an amazing journey. It’s certainly going to rank up there in the top of things I’ve done,” he said. --- People can learn more about Stewart’s expedition by visiting ---  expeditionunbound.com . ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – In 2010, Northeastern State University Cherokee Programs Director Dr. Leslie Hannah traveled to Esbjerg, Denmark, to teach the Cherokee culture and literature. That trip sparked interest for Danish students to study abroad in the Cherokee Nation, which they did recently. --- “I guess I stirred up enough interest that they wanted to come here and see for themselves. So last year, we had a group…from Esbjerg come and spend three weeks with us and they did pretty much the same thing that this group is doing,” Hannah said. --- This year, the three-week summer program had 10 Denmark students and one faculty sponsor participate. There were also two German students, who were already participating in a NSU exchange, who joined the Danes. --- “We’re trying to open up a two-way channel between here and Demark,” Hannah said. --- He said the Denmark students’ school requires they participate in international studies by traveling to different countries and learning those countries’ respective languages and cultures. --- “A few groups do come to the United States, but of the groups that come to the United States, most of them go to a large city like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, some place like that,” Hannah said. “They think that is America, which it is, but the groups that have come here, it’s interesting, and I still have correspondence with some of the students, they said ‘this is different. We feel like we’ve really seen America now, having come to Oklahoma.’” --- Students spent mornings working on English language skills, primarily writing and reading comprehension. In the afternoons, they saw different sites such as the Cherokee Heritage Center, Sequoyah’s Cabin, Cherokee National Supreme Court Museum, Murrell Home, Fort Gibson, Tahlonteeskee Courthouse and the Cherokee National Prison Museum. --- “I really like the Cherokee. My dad, he reads a lot about it, and he has told me things about the Indian and the old stuff and how they moved from the East Coast,” Dina Bach Sigmundsen, 16, said. “So it’s really inspiring to come here and hear so much about it.” --- Sigmundsen said her favorite part of the trip was the Cherokee Heritage Center in Park Hill. --- “I think it was nice to see the heritage center because to see how they lived, and the houses were not teepees as many of us thought. And it was nice to see how they lived and what they used, what resources they had,” she said. --- Students also participated in Cherokee cultural activities such as stickball, marbles, storytelling and basket weaving. --- “We’re trying to show them, basically, what it means to be Cherokee, especially here in the heart of Cherokee country in Tahlequah,” Hannah said. --- Students also learned some of the Cherokee language. --- “We have learned some words like ‘osiyo,’ and we have also learned how to count to 10,” Shpetim Sherifi, 17, said. “We have learned a lot.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Which foods are safe from pesticides and which should you buy organic? The Environmental Working Group has come out with its annual list to assist consumers asking that question. --- This year’s list has been expanded from the normal number of 12, also known as the Dirty Dozen, to 14. Called the Dirty Dozen Plus, it focuses on two crops: green beans and collard and kale. The EWG found that once again apples topped the list of fruits and vegetables, with 98 percent of apples containing pesticides. Onions was tops on the clean list of conventional fruits and vegetables. --- To determine which foods are most commonly contaminated with pesticides, the EWG analyzes data from scientists at the Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration. --- In addition to providing the percentage of fruits and veggies that contain pesticides, the group also considers the number of different kinds of bug killers that contaminate the produce. As in the case with conventional grapes, according to the EWG, 15 pesticides were detected on a single sample. --- Why is it important to avoid pesticides and eat organic? The toxic chemicals have been proven to cause decrease in birth weight and shorter pregnancies. But the good news is, again, it isn’t necessary to dump your whole refrigerator and run out and buy organic. There are many vegetables and fruits that contain significantly lower levels of pesticides. ---  Dirty Dozen Plus: Fruits and veggies that people should try to buy organic --- Apples --- Celery --- Sweet Bell Peppers --- Peaches --- Strawberries --- Nectarines (imported) --- Grapes --- Spinach --- Lettuce --- Cucumbers --- Blueberries (domestic) --- Potatoes --- Green Beans --- Kale/Greens ---  Clean 15: Fruits and vegetables lowest in pesticides --- Onions --- Sweet Corn --- Pineapples --- Avocado --- Cabbage --- Sweet Peas --- Asparagus --- Mangoes --- Eggplant --- Kiwi --- Cantaloupe --- Sweet Potatoes --- Grapefruit --- Watermelon --- Mushrooms --- The EWG stresses that overall it is better to eat your fruits and vegetables, even if you cannot purchase organic, but if you can, they recommend following this list.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Corey Still returned home on July 18 to Tahlequah after spending nearly two months in England. --- The Cherokee Nation citizen arrived in London on May 22 to work as a liaison and intern. He assisted with the “Emissaries of Peace” tour organized by Cherokee Nation Cultural Tourism and guided delegations from the CN, United Keetoowah Band and Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians when they arrived on June 15 to tour England. --- The “Emissaries of Peace” tour retraced the journey of British Lt. Henry Timberlake and three Cherokee chiefs in 1762 to meet King George III to cement peace between the two nations. ---  “Everywhere I went I was welcomed with hospitality and kindness,” Still said. “I was fortunate to be able to travel much of the southern country and was surprised to see all the country and woods that they have. It is probably one of the most beautiful places I have had the honor of experiencing in my life.” --- Still said his initial plan was to act as a tour guide for the Cherokee delegation. Eventually he took on the role of an ambassador by dressing in traditional Cherokee clothing, introducing the delegation in Cherokee and singing songs in Cherokee for English hosts. --- “I was once again honored when they asked me to do this. To think, that at my age of 21 years, I would be able to say that I have visited with these different dignitaries, spoke to them in my language and shared with them the culture that I was raised in,” he said. “We were all welcomed with great hospitality and kindness everywhere we went. From the lord mayors that we met, to the people on the streets, we felt like we were old friends who came to visit.” --- Still said his most interesting visit was the Wilton House located in southeastern England. It was one of the places the Cherokee delegation of Ostenaco, Cunne Shote and Woyi visited 250 years ago. --- “Not only was the estate something to be in awe of, the family that lived there were welcoming and excited that we were there,” he said. “The XVIII Earl of Pembroke, who resides at the Wilton House with his wife and young daughter were welcoming as could be with the delegation and even allowed us access to the private section of the house for afternoon tea.” --- At each stop, the Cherokee delegation presented gifts to their hosts, including blankets and baskets. Still said each stop added to his knowledge about the Cherokee delegation’s 1762 visit because he got to walk in the Cherokee leaders’ footsteps. --- “Nothing puts learning about a subject in history in full context until you visit the sites you study about first hand. To stand in the location those three chiefs stood 250 years ago is a mind-blowing aspect. It brings history to life being able to travel there and witness those things,” Still said. --- After the delegation returned home on June 23, Still visited schools across England making history and cultural presentations. --- “Being able to go and tell about my people to another country’s up-and-coming generation and to impart to them that not all American Indians are like what they see on the television was a great thing,” he said. --- A student at the University of Oklahoma, Still is working toward a bachelor’s degree in Native American Studies and is expected to graduate in 2013. He said he wants to pursue a master’s degree in higher education leadership at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah and a doctoral degree before eventually finding work serving the Cherokee communities. --- Still was able to travel to England through the Cherokee Nation Foundation. --- “The foundation has helped me so much in my higher education career and now this. I just truly feel blessed,” he said. This experience has given me a much broader view on life and the world. I have witnessed stunning sites, seen beautiful artwork that is hundreds of years old and traveled in the footsteps of my ancestors….This journey will help afford me a vast new perspective and has only furthered my resolve to work with culture, language and community.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TWIN OAKS, Okla. – “Where there is no vision, the people perish,” Proverbs 29:18. That Bible verse has kept Twin Oaks Baptist Church in Delaware County growing since its inception in 1963. --- Sue Maupin, parishioner and Cherokee Nation citizen, has attended the church for 49 years. Her mother, Narcie Cochran, had a vision of starting a church where everyone could attend but was closer to their homes. --- “Somehow that seed just grew in her mind,” Maupin said. “I guess the Lord spoke to her into starting a church somewhere in this area.” --- So Narcie and her husband George, along with Ike and Lou Postoak, started creating a church in the Twin Oaks area. It started as a mission of Euwasha Baptist Church in Kenwood, with the assistance of the Cherokee Missionary. But in 1963, church services and a Sunday school started in a former Postoak residence. At the time there were 31 members. --- In 1964, parishioner Curly Turtle donated two acres for a one-room church that was built between two oak trees, giving the church its Twin Oaks name. The Home Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention helped build the church by giving $1,000 to get it started. --- In 1966, the church became part of the Cherokee Baptist Association. An addition was later built with the help of the First Baptist Church of Kansas, Okla. It was called the educational wing for Sunday school classes. --- “It was like a little hallway that connected the educational building and the little one-room church, and from there it just started growing, knocking walls out, adding another wing to it,” Maupin said. --- Today in those classrooms, parishioners teach the Cherokee language to those wanting to learn. Parishioners also sing Cherokee hymns during services. --- After the church received its educational wing, it grew again by adding a dining hall and offices and extending the sanctuary. --- “Everything just clicked into place and, you know, that’s God’s will, when everything starts working together,” Maupin said. --- Today, the church stays active in the community, believes in the power of prayer and has been pastored by CN citizen Charlie Shell for the past six years. --- “When someone has a prayer request, it is sent on to our prayer chain. Before you know it, there are many, many people praying for the request made. It’s awesome to see the Lord at work,” parishioner Karen Bryant said. --- Bryant has worshipped at Twin Oaks Baptist Church for 30 years. --- “I’m very blessed to be part of this church. My family has been part of Long Prairie (Baptist Church in nearby Kansas) and Twin Oaks all my life and I know this is where I belong,” she said. “Our welcoming committee does a wonderful job at making visitors immediately feel at home here. So does our food committee for that matter. We try to make sure our visitors and members leave with a full stomach and a blessing.” --- Along with a meal every Sunday, the church also has penny marches, in which children collect pennies to give to a Cherokee missionary family from the area serving in Indonesia. Twin Oaks Baptist Church also supports and donates to other missions and missionaries not from the area. --- During the summer, the church holds its annual giveaway, in which parishioners and people outside of the church donate items such as clothes, household items and toys to families and organizations. --- The church also holds an annual Vacation Bible School. --- “The past few years we have been a popular place during Vacation Bible School,” Bryant said. “We’ve had to move classes to the kitchen and outside because we don’t have the room to house so many people. But I think that’s a good thing. We like to see adults and kids want to come to church.” --- In 2013, the church will celebrate its 50th year, something Maupin is thankful for. --- “The Lord saw fit that this was going to be it. This is where he wanted us to be,” she said. “We’ve had our ups and downs, but the Lord just always carries us through.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Stemming from a partnership with Cherokee Nation Businesses’ Citizen Development Initiative, the Cherokee Nation Foundation in June hosted its inaugural Cherokee College Prep Institute, allowing students to participate in interactive sessions focusing on college preparation. --- The institute, held June 17-22 at Sequoyah Schools, let students work with university representatives from across the nation. Students completed college applications, identified scholarship opportunities and explored schools of interest. --- “I saw it advertised and I decided that it would be a good first step in getting prepared for college,” said Josh Effary, a 17-year-old Stilwell High School senior. “I had already taken my ACT a couple of times and started filling out scholarship applications, but I knew I needed to do more and it was just a great opportunity to further my knowledge.” --- CNF officials launched the program after evaluating when students needed to start planning for college. The CNF has already established the Junior Achievement Program for fifth grade students and the Cherokee Scholars Program for middle school, but didn’t have anything for students entering college. --- The CNF – in cooperation with College Horizons, the U.S. Department of Education and the Princeton Review – developed the institute’s curriculum that includes interactive sessions focused on ACT strategies, essay writing, interview skills and time and finance management. --- “When we started looking around the United States for programs that were working, we saw that College Horizons was very successful with Native American students, so we collaborated with them in order to do this program this year,” CNF Executive Director Kimberlie Gilliland said. --- College Horizons is a non-profit organization supporting the higher education of American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students by providing college and graduate admissions workshops. --- During the institute’s five days, Sequoyah hosted 42 resident and nine commuter students. --- “We had a phenomenal number of students. They came in well prepared. They were incredibly disciplined,” Gilliland said. “Some of our days were from 6 in the morning to 8:30 at night. They were hard working and diligent. We were very pleased that we had almost 50 percent male and female, especially with college retention rates with our Native American male population.” --- College and scholarship representatives also helped the students by answering questions. Representatives from the American Indian College Fund, Northeastern State University, Princeton Review, Etiquette School of Tulsa, Texas Christian University, University of Arkansas, Oklahoma State University, Yale University, Dartmouth College, University of Oklahoma, Rogers State University, University of Central Arkansas and the University of Pennsylvania attended. --- “I think the best part of the program was just being able to be there and talk to a college rep,” Effary said. “They were there with us all week and it was just open questions. If we had a question, most of the time they could answer them. ” --- Participants were also assigned a CNF counselor to help them throughout their academic careers. For researching colleges and universities, students were given a website and advised to look at schools that fit their career choices. --- “One thing they told us to do was to make sure we research our colleges and to find the best fit for us,” Effary said. “The one that we think would best suite what we want to do in life, and I’m still in the process of doing that research.” --- Students also traveled to the University of Tulsa where student ambassadors gave a presentation and campus tour. The institute concluded with a ceremony to congratulate students on their success and distribute achievement awards. As part of the program, CNF officials will continue contacting students to help them with college preparations. --- “We’re going to meet with them either virtually or in person once a month over the next year to make sure that they are following the appropriate timeline and making deadlines for applications, both scholarship and university,” Gilliland said. --- Applications for the second annual Cherokee College Prep Institute will be accepted beginning Jan. 1.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) – Brayden Scott saw it as the opportunity to do something special. --- On June 23, the Sequoyah High School quarterback gave the University of Memphis an oral commitment to play football there once his upcoming senior season is completed. --- “I’ve just been thinking about it for the past two weeks and finally felt like it and wanted to go ahead and do it,” Scott said by telephone from Austin, Texas, where he was preparing to play in the International Federation of American Football’s Under-19 World Championship. “It’s an opportunity to help put Memphis on the map. I’d like to be the quarterback that helps make that happen.” --- Memphis is moving from Conference USA to the Big East, where it will begin play in Scott’s first year in college. --- The news didn’t initially reach his father and head coach at Sequoyah, Brent Scott, who said he first heard the news from his father. --- “Then someone from ESPN called me,” he said. --- Brent then got a call from Brayden after Brayden left meetings preparing for the Austin game. --- Brayden said he called Vance Vice, the Tigers’ offensive line coach and a former player of his grandfather, Bill, when the latter coached at Bristow, to tell him of his decision. --- “My roommate down here (Kansas City, Mo., native Trent Hosick) who has committed to play at Missouri, then got on Twitter,” Brayden said. --- Brent said he was a bit surprised at the timing because Nebraska had re-entered the picture, but wasn’t caught off guard by his son’s interest in the Tigers. --- “We went up there as a team to a Nike camp a month ago and the coaches pulled him aside. He toured the facilities, the offices, the weight room and talked to them a bit and he did come away liking what he saw,” Brent said. “When I talked to him tonight he said he just liked everything from the facilities to the new vision and that they’re joining the Big East.” --- Brayden is ranked by Rivals.com among the top 25 quarterbacks in the country. In his three seasons at Sequoyah, Scott has thrown for 5,423 yards and 64 touchdowns. --- The new Memphis regime has plenty of Oklahoma ties. First-year head coach Justin Fuente is a Tulsa native, who in 2011 was co-offensive coordinator at TCU. The quarterbacks coach there, Brad Cornelsen, was Kenny Evans’ offensive coordinator at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah. --- “I saw (Cornelson) a lot when he was at NSU. I’ve gotten to know Coach Fuentes well,” Brayden said. “He’s already helped put TCU on the map. He did a lot for Andy Dalton. I’m hoping he can help me in the same way.” --- Verbal commitments are non-binding. National signing day isn’t until February.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Tribal Council’s Resources Committee recently learned about a possible donation of 80 bison to the Cherokee Nation from Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. --- The bison are only available to Native American tribes and must be raised for commercial use, Natural Resources Director Pat Gwin said. --- “The bison retail for $3,500 a piece. They’re fairly expensive animals that we would get at no cost,” he said. --- Gwin added that raising and selling bison for meat is “lucrative” in today’s market, and bison byproducts such as the hide can also be sold. --- To research what would be required if the herd is accepted, Gwin consulted with Gerald Parsons, who serves on the National Bison Association’s Registry Committee and operates a bison ranch near Atoka. --- Parsons is willing to help the CN obtain the heard from Yellowstone, Gwin said. --- “I thought he was a very knowledgeable person, and he quelled a lot of fears I had about these animals,” he said. --- Gwin said Parsons has invited Natural Resources staff members to visit his ranch and that after the visit the costs associated with raising the bison would be evaluated and presented to the Resources Committee. --- He said if the council agrees to accept the buffalo and pay for the costs of fencing and raising them, two locations are being considered: the Candy Mink Springs Project site in Adair County and the Kenwood Project site in Delaware County, both tribal lands. --- Gwin said 400 acres are needed for the project and that Parsons told him that four acres of land is required for each bison. --- Also, cattle facilities will not work for a bison herd. A facility specifically for bison that includes special fencing must be built, he said. --- “The donation will be approved by Yellowstone, and they will not approve that donation until they come down and check off on your facility,” Gwin said. “Yellowstone enters into these agreements knowing these are going to be commercial animals, and they fully expect these animals to be used commercially.” --- Tribal Councilor Tina Glory Jordan voiced concerns about the bison herd getting sick. --- Gwin said a misconception about raising bison is that they are disease free and don’t require regular medical care. --- “Just like cattle, these animals do require annual medical treatment,” he said. --- She also asked if the council establishes a budget for the animals would the sale of the second generation begin to supplement that budget. Gwin said sales of the herd would eventually pay for their upkeep. --- “We’ll have those figures for you when we present something formally to the council,” Gwin said. ---  Bison meat is in demand --- The National Bison Association states several factors contribute to the demand for healthy bison meat. --- Growing numbers of consumers are discovering the direct connection between diet and health, and are actively seeking flavorful meats produced without the use of growth hormones or low-levels of antibiotics. --- A growing number of restaurants are adding recipes featuring all types of bison cuts, everything from brisket to short ribs. Active promotion by the NBA and independent marketers is spreading the word that buffalo is delicious and healthy. --- After hovering on the brink of extinction only a century ago, today bison producers can be found in all 50 states, every Canadian province and in several countries overseas. The 2007 Census of Agriculture reported that approximately 4,400 private ranches and farms today raise 198,000 head of bison across the United States. Approximately 25,000 additional animals are kept in public herds. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

NOWATA, Okla.
 – Cherokee Nation leaders joined Nowata residents on June 8 in dedicating the tribe’s new Nowata Food Center, which contains a senior nutrition center and CN Food Distribution store.
  --- CN Family Assistance Director Jerry Snell said this is the first time the Nation has combined a Food Distribution store and senior nutrition center in one building.
   --- “All of the nutrition sites are community-based. What will make this one unique is that we actually own it, and we will operate this site whereas at all the others sites we rely on the communities to supervise and run the facility,” he said.
    “This will be the first one that we have that we will be totally responsible for.”
  --- The senior nutrition site is the 13th CN-funded site that serves meals to the elderly.
  --- Snell estimates 45 to 60 seniors initially will use the facility, which includes a kitchen and a dining room. 
 --- “We hope that after we get going that the number of participants will grow,” he said. 
 --- Snell added that plans are to have the facility open three days a week, but it may open more often later if needed.
  --- “I want to believe that Nowata would be just like all of our other counties. A lot of our seniors are living on fixed incomes and have medication to purchase, and sometimes they’ll buy that medication before they’ll buy food,” he said. “We’ll be able to provide them three meals a week, and we’ll even have carryouts for them.”
  --- In 2011, CN senior nutrition sites served nearly 44,000 meals and delivered more than 17,000 meals to homebound elders. No income guidelines apply for senior nutrition eligibility.
  --- Snell said the nutrition center would also be used as a community center where community members can gather for meetings and events. Also, CN social workers will visit the center to provide information about tribal services and programs.
  --- CN citizen Helen Collier, 90, of Nowata, said she is glad the nutrition center is open because it allows her to socialize with other elders.
  --- “It’ll be a social place for me,” she said. “I’ve been watching it since they started clearing the ground. It is beautiful, and it’s really something Nowata has needed a long time.”
  --- Food Distribution Manager Bud Squirrel said clients began using the Food Distribution store to shop for food in March, which replaced semi trucks that delivered food to about 55 qualified families in the area.
  --- With deliveries, families were handed food from the back of the truck in all types of weather, he said.
  --- With the Nowata Food Center, families can shop in the comfort of a Food Distribution store that includes shelves filled with cereals, soups, fresh and canned fruits and vegetables, beans, juices and evaporated milk. Freezers stocked with various meats and cheeses are also in the store.
  --- “They got to come inside to a lot more comfortable surroundings and come in and shop for their foods on their own instead of getting it handed to them out of the back of truck in a box,” Squirrel said.
  --- Eligible families can shop in the store once a month, and the amount of food they receive depends on family size. To be eligible for Food Distribution services, a participant must be a citizen of a federally recognized tribe, have valid identification and meet income guidelines.
  --- Squirrel said since March, 145 families have been added to the Food Distribution list and that he expects the store to be serving 250 families in June.
  --- The city of Nowata donated land for the Nowata Food Center, which is located adjacent to the tribe’s Nowata Health Center on Galer Avenue.
  --- Dist. 4 Tribal Councilor Chuck Hoskin Jr., who helps represent Nowata County, said a direct benefit to the Nation’s investing in Nowata, first with a new health clinic and now the 5,000-square-foot food center, is employment.
  --- “We created jobs here, and when you think about that, it generates a lot economic activity for a community that desperately needs it,” Hoskin said. “And it’s a community on the move in part because of the investment that we’re making in Nowata. This building represents our commitment to taking care of the least of our brothers and sisters.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Since 1844, there has only been one Native American United Methodist Church in the Tahlequah area. And the Etchieson United Methodist Church still thrives today. --- “That’s how long the Methodist have been here,” Wynema Smith, church member and Cherokee Nation citizen, said. --- Smith has taught the Cherokee language for 20 years in different community buildings, at the church and at the tribe’s Cherokee Language Immersion School. --- Currently located on Seneca Street, the Etchieson United Methodist Church was first built near Park Hill and was called Riley Chapel. It moved to Seneca Street during the 1950s. --- “It was really a struggle when I first started here for the pastor and for the members, so we started serving meals every week to be able to pay our utilities and pay our pastor,” Smith, who began attending the church in 1985, said. --- In 2011, with the help of grants, fundraisers and CN funds, a larger church was built where the parsonage once stood, next to the old church. --- “This particular building here is sitting where the old parsonage, or the old house where the pastor used to be. And we needed more room, so there was a home over here where the parking lot is. So we just purchased that and made a parking lot out of it, and we find ourselves right now in a situation where we’re going to need more room as we go along because every Sunday we have had, since we dedicated the building in October 2011, we’ve seen new people come in,” Pastor Patrick Freeman said. --- While attending the Methodist-affiliated Oklahoma City University, Freeman was appointed to the Etchieson United Methodist Church as a student pastor in 1956. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation citizen later left for another church, but returned as pastor in 2001. He plans to retire in June. --- Church members still use the old church for Sunday school classes, while the new one-room church acts as a kitchen, dining area and church service area. With the new church, officials have seen attendance grow to more than 100. --- “We’re able to reach out now to where we weren’t before,” Freeman said. --- The church has citizens from different tribes attending such as Cherokee, Ponca, Muscogee Creek, United Keetoowah Band, Shawnee, Choctaw, Navajo, Kickapoo and Pottawattamie. --- “Some are visiting. Some we’ve added to our fellowship as members, and we see a pattern here that we’re going to probably continue to grow,” Freeman said. --- The church also has African American and Hispanic members, as well as Northeastern State University students from the campus ministries. --- Parishioners are involved with a United Methodist Church camp, in which they donate food and clothes for those who need it. They have monthly Indian taco fundraisers on the first Thursday. --- Since there are people representing different cultures who are part of the church, Freeman only preaches in English, but during worship there is a call for tribal hymns and each person is invited to sing hymns in their respective tribal languages. --- “We have several representations of different tribes, and if we can, we try to use their music, too,” Freeman said. “All the music that our tribes have is oral. There’s no written. You can’t use a musical instrument to the songs. The Cherokees have translated their songs into English, and they use different instruments. But most of the tribes have no instruments for their music.” --- Several church members sing in a Cherokee choir that is maintained by the Methodist Church. The group sings Cherokee hymns and has preformed in other states. --- “A lot of the tribes don’t have their written language, and that’s where we are really thankful for Sequoyah because he was the one that invented our syllabary that we can read and write,” Smith said. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

OKLAHOMA CITY –The 18-member House Native American Caucus has announced support of a planned American Indian Cultural Center along the banks of the Oklahoma River near downtown. --- Rep. Seneca Scott, of Tulsa and a member of the caucus, said on April 26 that it’s the first time in recent years that the caucus, which includes Republicans and Democrats, has unanimously endorsed a project. --- The state agency overseeing the center said it has secured $40 million in private funds to complete the project and is looking for an additional $40 million from the state. However, some legislators have criticized the museum’s estimated $171 million costs and House Speaker Kris Steele said there is little support for a state bond issue to help fund its completion. --- J. Blake Wade, executive director of the Native American Cultural and Educational Authority, which is developing the cultural center, said the center’s economic impact for the state is projected to be $3.8 billion during the first 20 years. It is also projected that the center will provide $150 million in state tax revenues. --- Tourism is the third-largest industry in Oklahoma with a $6.1 billion economic impact. --- “We have learned through years of studies that Oklahoma’s cultural tourism industry has great potential for economic development and job creation,” Wade said. “Those studies revealed that in order to be successful in cultural tourism, we have to focus on two of the things that make Oklahoma unique: the prevailing presence of cowboy and Western heritage and American Indian cultures.” --- Wade added that the caucus’ message to the Oklahoma Legislature is to work on capturing more of the tourist market and begin realizing the state’s investment. --- “It’s more than just another tourist attraction. This will position Oklahoma as an epicenter for cultural tourism,” he said. “European and Asian travelers are fascinated with Western heritage and American Indian cultures. Now is the time to invest in the American Indian Cultural Center and Museum, Oklahoma's newest international attraction.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – After opening in 2001, the Cherokee Language Immersion School held its first sixth grade graduation ceremony on May 14. --- “We have nine graduating sixth graders. We have eight girls and one boy and they’re very excited,” said Principal Holly Davis. “A lot of these kids have been in the program for nine and 10 years and this is our opportunity to acknowledge their hard work and their success with the language and to step into the next phase of their education through the language.” --- Graduating students are Cambria Bird, Emilee Chavez, Cheyenne Drowingbear, Cree Drowingbear, Lauren Grayson, Alayna Harkreader, Lauren Hummingbird, Sean Sikora and Maggie Sourjohn. --- While attending the school, students studied Cherokee culture and history, as well as regular school subjects such as science and math. English was introduced to them in the fifth grade to help transition them into a more traditional school setting. --- “Our ultimate goal is produce these fluent speakers who can come back and teach at immersion,” Davis said. “That’s ultimately what we’d love to see happen because at immersion, our teachers will not always be here. They’re going to end up retiring and going on with life, and we’ve got to be producing teachers to take their place. We’d love to see these kids go into college and graduate and come back and be our new teachers for immersion so that we can reach more kids because we’d love to see our school expand.” --- The school has added a higher grade each year. Now the graduating class will go to Sequoyah Schools’ seventh grade where their Cherokee education is expected to continue. --- “What we plan to do and right now, it’s just planning stages, we’ll use some of the immersion teachers to go over because these children, they have to participate in the language,” Davis said. “They’re going to get at least one subject during the day in Cherokee just to keep their skills fresh and to continue to grow and learn. Then as they enter as freshman, we hope to have a Cherokee 1, 2, 3 and 4.” --- Several graduating students such as Cheyenne and Cree Drowingbear have attended the school since it’s inception. --- “They were the first ones to start the very first day it opened up,” Charlie Drowningbear said of her children. “So they’ve been there since they were 3 years old.” --- The Drowningbear family moved from Alabama to Oklahoma so the children could attend the school. --- Cheyenne, 12, said she knew some Cherokee with help from her parents before she started school. --- “It is part of our culture, and it’s something that we live,” Charlie said. “Even though we speak it at school, we live it at home.” --- The graduation ceremony was primarily in the Cherokee language and held at Sequoyah’s The Place Where They Play with each student getting the chance to speak and sing in Cherokee. --- “It’s an opportunity to acknowledge their hard work, their parents’ hard work because it was a very hard decision to make, way back when, for these parents to decide to enroll their students and know that they were taking a little bit of a chance because it was a new program,” Davis said. --- Guest speakers included Principal Chief Bill John Baker and Education Director Dr. Neil Morton. --- Before the students received their diplomas from their teacher Curtis Washington, they received eagle feathers to wear on their caps from translation specialist John Ross and Education Services employees Harry Oosahwee and Dr. Gloria Sly. --- The ceremony closed with a prayer in Cherokee and a photo slideshow and video presentation of the students’ accomplishments. --- “We have nine kids that have accomplished something that no one else has ever accomplished,” said Marie Eubanks, sixth grade teaching assistant. “They are awesome students. They are fluent speakers, and hopefully they’ll keep on and succeed with the language.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

KENWOOD, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation-coordinated project to improve water quality in the Kenwood community in Delaware County is off and running. --- Billy Hix, CN Environmental Health and Engineering director, said Kenwood’s water system needed to be improved after the Environmental Protection Agency determined that wells serving the system are under the influence of surface water. --- “That means we’re going to have to treat the water a little different than it’s been treated in the past,” Hix said. “We’re going to have to actually build a water treatment plant that will filter the water.” --- He said under the old system water was chlorinated and sent into the distribution system. After the project is done, water will filter through two slow-sand filters and be treated at the water treatment plant before being sent to Kenwood residents’ homes. --- “We’ll be treating the water a little better than it’s been treated in the past, and hopefully it’ll get them better quality water,” Hix said. --- Kenwood resident Greg Butcher has been assisting the construction crew that is working on the water tower and has worked closely with Hix and the EPA to improve the water for Kenwood. --- “I’ve been helping with the design and layout of the project here,” Butcher said. “I think we’ll have a cleaner water source and a more reliable water source.” --- He added that once the water treatment plant is operational, Kenwood residents should not have to worry about surface water affecting the water supply, and they should have a more consistent water flow. --- Butcher said he hopes by the end of the year all of the systems associated with the new water system will be in place and operating. --- As part of the project’s first phase, Texas Aquastore, of Pottsboro, Texas is building an 83,000-gallon water tower. The initial phase also consists of laying approximately 4,500 feet of six-inch waterline and 4,400 feet of four-inch waterline along with building a new well control building, which is being done by D&amp;E Construction of Spavinaw. --- New wells have been drilled to complement current wells used by the community. New water lines from the wells will be installed to the water treatment plant and water tower situated above and northeast of Kenwood. --- Approximately 9,000 feet of waterline will be installed, Hix said. Also, backup generators will be installed at the wells in case of a power outage such as the one Kenwood experienced in recent years because of a recent ice storm. --- The water project will serve an estimated 158 homes in Kenwood along with the elementary school, Head Start, grocery store and community center. --- The total cost is estimated at is $1.1 million. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act supplied $200,000, while the EPA doled out $295,000. Another $90,000 from the Indian Health Service is paying for the treatment plant’s construction. --- The IHS also contributed $140,000 to go with $10,000 from the Nation for construction of the water tower. The IHS also picked up the inspection and engineering tabs totaling $63,000. --- The new wells and waterline are being paid for by the Federal Highways Indian Reservation Roads Program as part of a $325,000 bridge project in Kenwood. --- Hix said finding and coordinating funds for water and sanitation projects, as well as developing such projects, is one of his department’s primary roles. He said he and his staff have been working on the Kenwood project for more than five years. --- The second phase of the project is to construct the water treatment plant. --- “We hope to begin construction of the water treatment plant about the time that construction on the fist phase wraps up,” Hix said. “We are currently working on plans and specifications to submit to Cherokee Nation Environmental Protection Commission and EPA for approval. Once these are done, we will begin the bidding and contracting process.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – In the New Testament, 1 Timothy 6:18 states, “Tell them to use their money to do good. They should be rich in good works and should give happily to those in need, always being ready to share with others whatever God has given them.” --- This is Scripture concerning to give to those in need, something the members of the Elm Tree Baptist Church take seriously. --- “The people here are really mission-minded,” church member Frances McCarter said. “If they see a need, they’re going to give and that’s a good thing about the people here.” --- Members donate to food pantries. Handmade items go to local hospitals and shoes to different tribal reservations during Christmas. They also support the Oaks Indian Mission in Oaks, New Tribes Mission in Sanford, Fla., the Southern Baptist Convention and the Ronald McDonald House Charities based in Oak Brook, Ill. --- The church has even started a community garden to benefit those in need. --- “Anytime they say ‘well, this is the need,’ then everybody works with it,” McCarter said. --- Her husband, D.J., is the church’s pastor and moderator of the Cherokee Baptist Association, a group the Elm Tree Baptist Church has been a part of since its inception in 1954. --- In 1957, members built the old Elm Tree Baptist Church, which was located on Cedar Avenue. That building seated only about 70 people so church officials eventually sold the building. In 2007, the church moved to its current location off of North Bliss Avenue. --- “This building that is here, only the outside metal part, the floor and the sheet rock were contracted,” D.J. said. “The men of the church and the ladies of the church did the rest. We had a group from Hot Springs, Ark., Second Baptist Church, they did all of the electrical wiring and they furnished the wiring.” --- The church also had a Louisiana group volunteer its time to help build onto the Elm Tree Church. One room that was built became a library so members and non-members can check out books. --- Though the congregation is mostly Cherokees, the church has members from different tribes such as the Kiowa, Creek, Choctaw, Pawnee and the Ponca. --- D.J. said he normally preaches in English, but in April he started preaching in Cherokee on Sunday evenings. --- “They request it and I enjoy doing it,” he said. --- On Wednesday evenings, employees from the Cherokee Language Immersion School come and teach the Cherokee language and Cherokee hymns to the church’s congregation. --- “The older ones should be teaching the young ones because they’ve experienced things that a younger teacher probably never would have experienced in their life right now. But us older people, we can teach and relate to them the things that have happened in our lives,” Frances said. --- During services, members, including children, get on stage and sing Cherokee hymns. --- “Anybody can get up there and sing if they want to,” D.J. said. “I’d like to see everyone of our children get up there and be able to sing Cherokee.” --- D.J. has been a part of the church for 22 years, and during that time he said the best thing about the church is the people and their willingness to give. --- “They’re willing. They are willing, and you put something out there before them they’re ready to get after it,” he said. “There’s something about giving, and they break their backs to give. It’s good to pastor a church like that.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

STILWELL, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation’s Bright Futures Truancy Prevention Program is attempting to fight high dropout rates in Adair County where nearly half of the schools’ populations are Cherokee. --- According to the Oklahoma State Department of Education Dropout Reports, 123 students dropped out of Adair County high schools during the 2006-07 academic year. Eighty-four of them were reported to be Native American. Bright Futures was established four years ago because of such numbers. --- “A few years back, we were seeing a lot of kids that were in the juvenile justice system, so we kind of did some interviews with juvenile justice through the state and then found that truancy is kind of like the gateway to delinquency in a lot of cases,” said J.R. Claphan, court truancy advocate. --- Bright Futures advocates act as intermediaries between the county courts, the schools and the families involved, said Claphan. Social workers receive referrals from schools at certain stages of a student’s attendance problems. --- Schools contact Bright Futures after a student’s third absence, said school advocate Letisha Locust. The advocates then go to the family to discover the cause of the student’s absences. Reasons for truancy usually vary on a case-by-case basis. Once a student reaches seven absences, their parents are then ticketed and the family is brought into truancy court. --- Locust said the most common cause for truancy issues is the lack of respect for a proper education on behalf of the parents. --- “They just don’t value it (education). I don’t know how many parents I’ve had with teenagers that have told me, ‘Well, they’re old enough to make their own decisions,’” Locust said. “They just let them do what they want to do at that point.” --- Claphan said shyness is a major reason why students do not want to attend school. He said when students come from small schools such as Bell or Dahlonegah, they receive “culture shock” when transitioning to a freshman class that is larger than their previous school combined. --- “You may not even see the people from your school, you know, you kind of get lost,” Claphan said. “you may be 14 years old, but you’re in there with kids that are 18, 19, and I think a lot of it is that it scares a lot of them. It’s a big transition for them.” --- Claphan said the program receives help from Judge Elizabeth Brown, a CN citizen who initiated the truancy court several years ago. --- “I’ve been to some administrator meetings, and I’m told by them they believe it is working,” Brown said in a 2011 Cherokee Phoenix article. “I think it’s working. You can see a drastic change in the attendance of most of the children.” --- That change is evident by the decreasing number of dropouts in the Native community since the program’s initiation. The 2007 dropout report showed that 84 Native students left school. In 2008, that number decreased to 52. A year later, there were only 18 Native American students who dropped out of an Adair County high school. However, those numbers have seen a rise again the past two years, with 20 and 34 dropouts in 2010 and 2011, respectively. --- “Sometimes they can make you feel like you’re just beating your head against the wall, and then there’s that one moment where you’re like, ‘OK, it’s working. Thank you,” Locust said. ---  todd-crow@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

KANSAS, Okla. – Since 2006, teachers at the Kansas Head Start have been teaching their students a language other than English. They’ve been teaching Cherokee. --- “We have to incorporate another language and since the majority of our students are Native American and Cherokee, we decided that that would be the most appropriate to teach,” teacher Nicole Everhart said. --- As of April 26, Kansas Head Start had 17 students enrolled, with 15 of them being Cherokee. --- Cherokee Nation citizen Helen Ketcher, who has worked with Head Start programs for approximately 20 years, works at the Kansas Head Start and helps teach the Cherokee language. --- “This is my heritage and I like to keep it going for some of the kids,” she said. “I know some of the kids probably don’t get to hear that at home anymore, so I just try to get that in there for them.” --- The teachers instruct students on how to say simple things in Cherokee such as greetings, days of the week, food, walk, stop and more. --- Ketcher said the children like to repeat what they learned in Cherokee throughout the day. --- The teachers have also created a song for the days of the week in Cherokee so it’s easier for the children to learn. --- “I’m learning right along with them and it’s kind of fun. It’s neat because they learn it faster than I do,” special needs aid Mishelle Young said. “They say that if you teach a child their second language by the time they’re 5 years old, then they can learn all of it and retain it their whole life whereas an adult can’t do that. --- “It’s a great program and I love the fact that we incorporate something that’s original from the country instead of bringing other stuff in,” Young added. --- The teachers also created signs in Cherokee that read “water,” “science” and “reading” and are located in different areas in the classroom. --- Head Start has served nearly 30 million children since its inception in 1965 under President Lyndon Johnson. Its goal is to help children become ready for kindergarten and provide health care and food support. --- Head Start schools are federally funded and administered by the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services. Head Start serves children and families each year in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories, including American Indian, Alaskan Native and migrant/seasonal communities. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

CALHOUN, Ga. – The Cherokee Nation Tribal Council approved a resolution April 16 to “commend the preservation” of the New Echota Historic Site, which opened 50 years ago as a Georgia historical landmark. --- New Echota served as the CN capital from 1825 to 1832 before the tribe’s government was forced to move its capital to nearby Red Clay, Tenn. The site is where the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper was born and first printed. It is also where the Treaty of New Echota was signed by an unauthorized group of Cherokee leaders in December 1835, which gave up remaining Cherokee land in the tribe’s original territory. --- Today, the site is an historic site operated by Georgia. The site, now designated a National Historic Landmark, was opened in 1962 after archeologists uncovered 1,700 artifacts and 600 items that belonged to Cherokee people during excavations of the former town. --- Today, visitors can see 12 original and reconstructed buildings, including a council house, courthouse, print shop, missionary Samuel Worcester’s home and an 1805 store, as well as outbuildings such as smoke houses, corn cribs and barns. There is also a visitor center at the site. --- As part of the site’s 50th anniversary on May 12 The Friends of New Echota Historic Site and New Harmonies will team up to sponsor activities for visitors. --- “Without the support of our Friends of New Echota group, New Echota would not be able to offer the great programming activities visitors enjoy throughout the year at our site,” said New Echota Historic Site Manager David Gomez. --- New Harmonies, a music group that celebrates American roots music, will sponsor participation by renowned CN citizen and singer Barbara McAllister as part of the program. Singing in both Cherokee and English languages, McAllister will perform two songs. --- The Friends of New Echota Historic Site will provide various services for visitors during the 50th anniversary program. --- In recognition of New Echota’s 50 years as a public site, dedicated and talented volunteers have designed commemorative calendars, posters and shirts, Gomez said. --- “This land was preserved and the park was created because of the initial interest and efforts of local Calhoun and Gordon County citizens over 50 years ago, and the support of the local community over these years is what has made it a success,” he said.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The Cherokee Arts Center at 212 S. Water St. is helping Native artists old and young find the resources they need to sharpen their skills and turn their crafts into businesses. --- CAC staff members are certified through the First Peoples Fund, a South Dakota-based organization that supports creative community-centered First Peoples artists, to teach artists who are looking to become more grounded in their business skills, Ryan Lee Smith, cultural resource specialist, said. --- Smith said the CAC is a “small business incubator for artists.” In addition to the small business training, the CAC provides space for artists to work on and display their art. --- “We offer them a place to, number one, to show their stuff in the gallery for some retail,” Smith said. “We offer them workspaces, like we have a ceramics, pottery studio back here with two big kilns that we’ll have people come in and teach with.” --- Smith said the CAC acts as a “platform” for established artists, emerging artists and those yet to see their talent recognized. He said the CAC employees help with assembling portfolios, promotional packets and to be the mediators between the artists and administration. --- “I’m here to talk to the artist, see what they need, facilitate whatever they need, but we’re not giving anything away,” Smith said. “It’s kind of a self-help thing. You can come in here and work and teach these classes, make your money and keep it going.” --- Smith said several artists, including Cherokee National Treasures Dorothy Ice, Knokovtee Scott and Jane Osti, have used the CAC to pass on their crafts to aspiring artists. The CAC takes a small deposit and does the promoting for the class, but how much the artist wants to charge students is up to the artist. --- “We’re here strictly for the artist,” Smith said. “There’s no incubator kind of thing that I know of around here, especially that targets Native artists, and tried to empower them, promote them, encourage them to do better, make money and find worth in the stuff they’re doing. And also to preserve art that otherwise would be lost.” --- Cherokee Nation employee and loom weaver Candessa Tehee said she shares the concern for dying art forms, which is why she began taking Dorothy Ice’s loom weaving class at the CAC. She said she remembers reading an article from 1978 in which her grandfather said, “no one’s loom weaving anymore,” and that there are only a handful of loom weavers living today. --- “If we don’t start picking up this real, true Cherokee tradition, then, you know I worry that it really will die,” Tehee said. “Hopefully other Cherokees out there are going to go, ‘Hey, look. I can do this, too.’ And they can do it with the help of the Cherokee Arts Center.” --- Tehee said she first heard about the CAC when it was advertised in Ice’s loom weaving class. Tehee’s background was in finger weaving but thought tabletop loom weaving was the next step in following in her grandfather’s footsteps. After taking the class and visiting with fellow artists, she spoke with CAC employees about obtaining a loom, and they helped her obtain a small business loan through the CN. --- “I got with Donna (Tinnin, supervisor for Community Tourism) and she pointed me in the right direction,” Tehee said. “I turned in my forms and it was about a week and a half later, maybe, I had a check. It took longer for my loom to come in than it did for the loan to go through.” ---  todd-crow@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation Indian Child Welfare has a new Facebook page, “Homes for Cherokee Kids.” --- “If you have a Facebook account, go like the page and share this page with your Facebook friends,” ICW child welfare specialist Heather Baker said. “ICW is always seeking Native American foster homes for our Cherokee children.” --- Baker said the page is geared towards “recruiting and educating Native Americans” who may be interested in foster care or adoption of Native children. --- “ICW is exploring all options to reach Native Americans interested in foster care, as we are at an epidemic low in homes for our children in need,” she said. --- She added that many of the staff member have personal Facebook accounts. --- “(They have) seen first hand the vast amount of Native Americans who are ‘facebooking’ and who have interest in their culture and most importantly the well being of children,” Baker said. “We easily put two and two together, to conclude, we need a FB (Facebook) page.” --- She said the goal is to reach as many “Native American brothers and sisters” as possible, educate them on what the ICW is doing and show how much of a need is out there to care for Cherokee children. --- For more information, call 918-458-6900 or find ICW on Facebook.

KANSAS, Okla. – Long Prairie Baptist Church, one of the oldest Cherokee churches within the Cherokee Nation, celebrated its 183rd anniversary on March 25. --- “There was a storage building that had all the records, but it burned down some time ago. But from what we can determine it’s about that old,” said Pastor Jesse Glass. “They say it’s older than that, but this is the best they can do to determine that.” --- Church officials said the church was established between 1824 and 1829 when Baptist missionary Issac Watt and four teachers came to Oklahoma to build a church. The building was also used as a school for Cherokees. Children attending were taught to read and write in Cherokee and English, using the Bible for reference. --- “They (Cherokees parents) wanted to get their children educated and keep them educated,” said Rocky Carroll, a CN citizen who helps with the church’s functions. “So the church was a good place to gather, not just on Sunday or Saturday but during the week.” --- In the 1940s, church members placed the one-room church on skids and moved it to its current location along Highway 412 West, on the south end of Daytown Road in Delaware County. The structure of the building remains the same, along with the steeple and the bell. --- “I remember how the old folks used to tell me how they got it up there,” church member George Cochran said. “It used to be higher. They made it lower and the ceiling used to be higher, but they made the roof a lot lower here. They used mules to put that bell up there, a team of mules. They were almost lying down, what they used to tell me, when they put that bell up there because it’s so heavy.” --- Cochran said his family has been attending the Long Prairie Baptist Church for several years. --- A lot of the members who attend today are ancestors of those who originally attended the church when it was first built, including the Glasses, Snells, Mouses and Drywaters. --- “It seems that there’s always somebody in the family, a direct member,” Carroll said. --- In the 1970s a small room was added to the church so children could attend Sunday school. Approximately a year ago, the inside of the church was vandalized along with the church’s original podium, which the members were able to fix. While most of the inside is new, the original wooden beams and window frames still show and the structure remains the same. --- “There’s been a lot of improvements that’s been done here within the last few years,” Cochran said. “The graveyard has gotten bigger and the road has been fixed, before it was just like a wagon trail. So it’s gotten bigger.” --- The church also has the original communion goblets that were brought along on the Trail of Tears. An elder member of the church keeps the goblets at home, but members still use the goblets for different occasions. --- “They use them at their quarter meetings. They are always here for communion, before baptizings, things such as that,” Carroll said. “It’s not just an artifact they put on display. --- “So many of the families never forget the roots of it, the heritage of it,” Carroll added. --- Long Prairie Baptist Church has quarterly meetings on the fourth Sunday in January, April, July and October. The church is also a charter member of the Cherokee Baptist Association, and the Constitution of the Cherokee Baptist Sunday School was adopted in 1898 at Long Prairie Baptist Church. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5000, ext. 6139

PARK HILL, Okla. – The Cherokee Heritage Center held its annual Indian Territory Days March 29-30, showing young students from all over northeast Oklahoma and surrounding areas a glimpse at the history, culture and lifestyle of Cherokees living in Indian Territory. --- “Basically, the idea is, with the mission of the Cherokee Heritage Center, which is to preserve, promote and teach Cherokee history and culture,” CHC Development Director Penny Moore said. “So having students come out, young students, they have the opportunity to see what our history and culture is all about.” --- Moore said the event was expected to bring in more than 360 students from ages 4 to 13 on the first day alone, and more than 600 students throughout the two days. Those students were able to participate in more than 16 stations, including stickball, blowguns, basket weaving, cultural storytelling, cooking demonstrations, marbles and more. --- Greg McCoy, a teacher’s assistant at Brushy Elementary School in Sallisaw, said he recently started teaching a class once or twice a week on Cherokee culture and history. McCoy was one of several teachers to take a group of students to Indian Territory Days. --- “It’s to help educate my students there at Brushy to their Cherokee heritage, to see how the people lived back in the 1800s, 1850s, 1890s, how the Cherokee people used to live,” McCoy said. “They like the blowgun activity. They like that, and of course, they like the stickball.” --- Along with the blowguns and stickball, Moore said the crafts are always a hit at the event, primarily because anything students they can take home. --- “What I think the favorite part in terms of any of the crafts is that the student, whether it’s an adult student or young student, we get to take the craft home with us,” Moore said. “To me, the favorite part is creating a craft, doing the hand craft. I think that’s a lot of fun, and then be able to take it home and tell the story about it.” --- Although some of the event’s workers were CHC employees, many were volunteers from around the Cherokee community, Moore said. --- “The majority of them are Cherokee Nation members, and so they’re very familiar with the traditional and historical, cultural activities that are done here at the center,” Moore said. --- Principal Chief Bill John Baker and Deputy Chief S. Joe Crittenden were present to take part in the event as well, walking around and encouraging students as they used the blowguns and played stickball. --- “An event like this, as the chief and council, we take oath to promote the culture, heritage and language of the Cherokee Nation,” Baker said. “This is a day that we can get 400 kids out to see how things were hundreds of years ago, and they get to shoot the blowguns, they get to play marbles, they hear the old stories of our storytellers. It’s a great opportunity to pass on our story.” ---  todd-crow@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

Editor's note: This is the final feature in the Cherokee Phoenix's Cherokee Translators series. To read the five previous stories, go to the Culture section of the website. --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Dennis Sixkiller grew up in Jay speaking Cherokee as his first language. However, as he got older, he said he began to use the language less and less, becoming an a good example of “use it or lose it.” --- “I could understand it all, but I wasn’t using it or talking it. I had to go back and learn how to talk and how to say some of the words in Cherokee,” he said. “Still have some words that I have problems pronouncing, but as far as using it daily. You really have to keep on using it or you will lose it.” --- Sixkiller works as a CN translation specialist and learned to read and write Cherokee about 10 years ago. He said working in the translation department helps increase his language knowledge. --- “I really have to dig deep in dictionaries, English and in Cherokee, to find these words and a proper or better definition of the word. That’s how I translate words, and I think a lot of us do it that way, too,” he said. “It is really challenging and our language is really complex in every way.” --- Aside from translating, Sixkiller produces a radio show on Tahlequah radio station Lakes Country 102.1 FM on Sundays as well as teaches the language in Cherokee communities. --- “There is a challenge there (in the communities) too because I have some that are fluent, some know a little, some a little more and some just beginning,” he said. --- After having taught in communities and worked with the Cherokee Language Immersion School, Sixkiller said the revitalization of the Cherokee language has a long way to go. --- “The children now-a-days may not be as fluent and speak like we do, they might talk a little bit different, but they can get to the fluency part if they really get after it,” he said. “If they put their whole heart into it. Like anything else you have to have that desire to learn. You got to want to, but we still have a long ways to go, I believe.” --- Sixkiller also helps with the revitalization efforts as part of a consortium group between the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina and the CN. The group meets about four times a year. --- “We all get together and we translate words, and so far we have translated probably over 1,000 words in the last three years,” he said. “I really enjoy that and meeting with them because their language is a little different than ours. We get together and we agree on one word and they say it their way and we say it our way.” --- Sixkiller said he hopes to leave a legacy not only for his children and grandchildren, but also for anyone with a desire to keep the Cherokee language alive. --- “Maybe (they) will pick up what I have left behind, what I’ve translated or recorded…they might pick it up and have a desire to want to learn and hopefully while I’m living,” he said. --- “I interviewed an elder not too long ago and he told me that the day that you lose your language is the day that we lose our identity as a Cherokee. And that really sticks out to me and I don’t ever want to lose the language.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation translation specialist Durbin Feeling said curiosity led to his learning to read and write the Cherokee language. --- “I learned to read (Cherokee) when I was 12 years old. I learned that while watching my dad always reading his testament,” Feeling said. “One day when I was playing around I got curious and stood by him, and what he would do is take his pen out and guide me while he was reading.” --- Feeling said eventually he picked out short words to read. --- “Maybe I would read about two syllables or something like that and the next syllable I may not know, so I went to the back of the testament where there was a pronunciation guide…I would go back and forth like that. It’s kind of self-taught I guess,” he said. --- Becoming literate in the language eventually led Feeling to the CN, where he’s worked off and on for 30 years. He said he initially worked in the translation department. Today, he still translates, but with better technology. --- He said he just finished making 12,000 Cherokee words available on Google and that his work is compatible with Apple’s iPhone and Droid smartphones. --- “Much of the things can be written in Cherokee in Google. You can also text and email in Cherokee,” he said. --- Feeling said the language has progressed in the past decade because of technology and the tribe’s Cherokee Language Immersion School. --- “It’s quite a ways in the last maybe 10 years I should say because I think the best thing that has happened so far is the immersion. Even though the kids aren’t picking up the words that well yet,” he said. --- He said immersion students are slowly learning the language because it is complex. --- “So it’s kind of challenging, and I think some of those things are the things that the kids are slow in picking up, but hopefully they will.” --- Feeling said there are many things he’s proud to be associated with, such as writing books, helping create the Cherokee dictionary and teaching at Northeastern State University, but he’s also proud of his translation work. --- Translating the language, he said, is how one becomes immersed in the language and that’s when one can really “know” the language. --- “A person can speak, but until they get into translation and become familiar with the parts of speech and the morphology and all the other things that go into learning a language, the linguistic part, that’s when a person will really have learned their language,” he said. “You got to do your own work. We shouldn’t look at it negative. We have a guy who is a student at Northeastern. He was 16 years old when he first came to the conference. He was already studying on his own. He taught the syllabary to himself. He could read, but he couldn’t understand what he was reading.” --- Feeling said when he came to the CN in 1976 he was teaching in communities and that students needed learning materials then and still do. --- “I realized that the students need other things, you know learning materials and things. I started doing what the students needed and kind of neglected the teaching part…The boss that I had said ‘you got to be out there teaching. That’s why I hired you. Don’t be sitting around writing things,’ But that’s exactly what they need. We need a lot of research even today in Cherokee. There are documents and literature out there that hasn’t even been touched at all.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen David Crawler has always had an interest in the Cherokee language. Working for the tribe’s translation department , he translates everything from books for the Cherokee Language Immersion School to signs for the tribe and health clinics. --- He said his first language was Cherokee and he wasn’t introduced to English until attending public school. However, unlike many people learning a new language, he didn’t have a hard time. --- “I was 7 years old when I first went to school, and I believe it was about that time we learned English, but it was not a difficult the transition (for me),” he said. --- Crawler said he was a teenager when he learned to read and write Cherokee. --- “When I went to high school up here at Sequoyah, I met this guy Durbin Feeling, and he had a Cherokee class there. So I took that class and I learned more,” he said. “So maybe in a week’s time I could read and writing came next. I was probably 16 years old at that time.” --- Crawler said he’s always been interested in the Cherokee language and was recruited for the translation department by word of mouth. --- “I always liked reading and writing in Cherokee…when I learned to write real good, someone told them (translation department) about me here and they paid me a visit one day and then brought me here on contract work and then later they hired me on full time to translate,” he said. --- He said putting into words his love of translating is hard because there is not one aspect of that he loves more than the others. “I just like doing what I do.” --- He said he has many stories written in the Cherokee syllabary on sheets of paper and that he would like to see those stories put into a book. --- “What I’d like to see is to have all these story books of traditional stories all in English (written) all in the syllabary,” he said. “I got so many that I’d like to see all that put into a book for.” --- Crawler said the translators often run into problems while translating stories for immersion students or even the Cherokee Phoenix where an English word may not exist in the Cherokee language. --- “Sometimes we run into a place where we cannot say what it is because there is just no word. It doesn’t make any since in Cherokee. And that goes with the Phoenix too,” he said. “One day I went to (Durbin) and asked in this little phrase here it says ‘she clutched her heart’ and how do you do that in Cherokee? It’s impossible. We can say she done it, but in the way we would think (in Cherokee) is she took it out, literally. That’s the problem we run into a lot.” --- However, Crawler said his favorite part of the job is working with immersion students. --- “I see some little children up at immersion (school) and we talk Cherokee and some aren’t as good as others, but I think we’ve come a long way,” Crawler said. --- He said he would also like to see immersion teachers write their own stories in the Cherokee language for their students. --- “I would like to see us train those teachers to do those stories. Everybody tells stories. We tell stories all the time and maybe when you go home that’s a story,” he said. “There’s a lot of work still (for the language), a lot of work.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ---  918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Evenings listening to her parents tell Cherokee legends and stories from the Bible began Anna Sixkiller’s journey to becoming a Cherokee Nation translation specialist. --- Sixkiller, 66, grew up in the Leach community in Delaware County and Cherokee was the only language she knew until school. --- “That was the language in our home. My parents both spoke the language. I just learned by listening and hearing it every day,” she said. “As I was growing up I thought that was the only language people spoke, but I learned otherwise when I started school.” --- After dinner, her family listened to her father tell Cherokee legend stories, the same stories now shared in books created by the CN translation department. --- “The stories they told back then were the lessons to be learned when you were growing up. They meant for you to think about the stories being told and learn from it,” she said. “When it was Momma’s turn to tell stories, she read the Bible.” --- As a girl, Sixkiller knew she would have to learn to read the Cherokee syllabary before she could read her mother’s Cherokee Bible. But it wasn’t until she was older with her own children when she became dedicated to reading the Cherokee Bible and learning to write the syllabary. --- “I had studied it throughout the years, but then one day I picked up the Bible and read a verse and then from then on I read a whole chapter. What motivated me was seeing Mom reading stories from this book,” she said. --- She began working for the CN Cultural Resource Center in 2000, working with the language. Previous to that she taught Cherokee in communities for 12 years. She said when she taught Cherokee, phonetics was used instead of the syllabary to help people learn. --- Since 2000, Sixkiller said there’s been a shift, with the syllabary largely replacing phonetics when the language is taught. She said she hears the language being spoken more than it was 10 years ago. --- “For me, I just learned the syllabary and for a long time it was very hard for me to use phonetics,” she said. “To me, if that (phonetics) is what’s going to teach a person to pronounce and talk the language then I think it’s good, but still yet the syllabary was invented by Sequoyah and that’s our language.” --- She believes it is easier for a person who speaks the language to learn how to read and write it. However, being a translator requires more than knowing how to speak Cherokee. --- “To be a translator you have to think in the language. You have to think in Cherokee,” she said. --- She and the translation department are asked to help people and programs with translations. --- Along with translating materials for the Cherokee Language Immersion School, she also translates for universities, libraries, the tribe’s Cultural Tourism and clinics and hospitals. She also translates inside and outside signage for CN buildings and casinos, including parking and stop signs. --- Before the translation department hired more staff, Sixkiller translated stories from English to Cherokee for the Cherokee Phoenix. Sometimes, she said, she translated up to five stories for an issue within two or three days. Now, other translation specialists help her translate two to four articles a month for the tribal newspaper and website. --- “It gets easier and easier, and now I can probably translate an article in two and a half hours, three at the most,” she said. --- At times, when translating a news story or document, she said the staff must consult the Cherokee Bible or other older documents written in Cherokee to find the proper words. It can be a challenge, but Sixkiller said she enjoys it because it allows her to discover new words and explore Cherokee thought written in the syllabary. --- Some older documents, more than a century old, force the translation department to gather to provide input about the meaning of old Cherokee words that are no longer used. --- “When there’s more people to study then we throw ideas around, and we say ‘I think they meant this.’ After awhile it all comes together,” she said. --- Sixkiller said she considers her translation legacy at times. Many books and documents she has translated into Cherokee have her name on them. --- “My great-great-great grandchildren may pick up a book and say ‘I know this person. That was my great-great-great grandma.’ That’s what I think I’m leaving behind,” she said. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation translation specialists Phyllis Edwards first learned the Cherokee syllabary from her uncle Ben Bush when she was a young girl. --- “My first language was the Cherokee language. That was all that was taught in the home. I was about 6 years old when I first starting learning the English language and it was very hard.” --- She was 8 years old when her uncle began teaching her, her siblings and cousins how to use the Cherokee syllabary chart. --- “After a stickball game at the (stomp) grounds, he would take the young kids and he would sit down and teach the syllabary charts,” she said. “He did that for maybe two years and then he passed away.” --- After his death, everyone “drifted away” from the syllabary because nobody took his place, she said. --- Edwards, who was raised in Marble City in Sequoyah County, was reintroduced to the syllabary chart about four years ago, when the CN began sponsoring Cherokee language classes in communities. She attended a class for two years and relearned how to read and write the syllabary. --- About three years ago, the place where she had worked for 32 years in Fort Smith, Ark., closed, which led her to the tribe and its translation department. --- “I had always wanted to work on something like this (language), and then somebody mentioned they (CN) may have an opening for a translator and so I applied and got it,” she said. “To me, I think everything that we do here in this department is important. You can’t say this is more important than this, and that’s also dealing with the public…if you can help them it makes you feel good that you were able to help somebody.” --- Edwards said she didn’t teach her children how to speak Cherokee because of the difficulties she had while attending public school. --- “The reason I really did not really push our language in my home was I had such a problem when I started when I was 6 years old. It was like going to a different world trying to understand the English language,” she said. “You were not allowed to talk Cherokee, and there was not anyone available at that time like a bilingual speaker to translate what was being said to us. --- “I did not want to put my kids in that situation, so therefore I let them learn the English language so it would be easier on them because you don’t how it is to feel like that where you are thrown into a situation where you don’t understand what’s going or what’s expected of you,” she added. --- Edwards said the trauma of being forced to learn English has stayed with her, but she regrets not teaching her two children to speak Cherokee. --- “They understand (Cherokee) to a certain extent, but they do not speak the language,” she said. “My children are saying ‘why didn’t you just go ahead and teach us.’” --- The result of her children’s generation not learning to speak Cherokee is a language gap between her generation and the generation of children attending the Cherokee Language Immersion School. --- The future of the language may rest in the hands of the 100 or so students at the immersion school, and Edwards said she is happy to support the school and enjoys visiting the students. --- “I just love to hear them talk. They’ll come running to you saying ‘osiyo, osiyo’ (hello). It’s so good to hear that.” --- She said it’s not important that the children always speak proper Cherokee as long as the elder speakers can understand them and there is communication occurring. --- “In each community the language is spoken differently, and there’s dialects, and I think it can be wrong. I mean, so long as two people can communicate with each other and understand what is being said, I think that’s fine,” she said. --- She also understands that even with the efforts being made to save the language, it’s not safe from disappearing. But she’s hopeful the technology such as iPhones and iPads that translators and immersion students use will help save it. --- “There are also translated books that young children or anybody can use as a reference and then we have the (language) CDs,” she said. --- Edwards added that thanks in part to the translation staff, there is more Cherokee syllabary material available for people who want to study the language and learn to read and write it. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

Editor's note: The Cherokee Phoenix is running a six-part series on the Cherokee Nation Translation Specialists. Cherokee Nation translation specialists are Dennis Sixkiller, Anna Sixkiller, David Pettit, Durbin Feeling, John Ross and Phyllis Edwards. The stories will run every other day. --- TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee speaker and translator John Ross is focused and determined to do his part in preserving the Cherokee language. --- Ross, 56, originally of the Greasy Community in Adair County, is one of six translation specialists in the Cherokee Nation’s translation department where documents, signs, books and other printed items are translated from English into Cherokee. --- Ross said his main task is translating three books a month for Cherokee Immersion School students. “That’s our priority. Then we work with all the departments in the Cherokee Nation. We translate words and phrases, and we do about 30 translations a month.” --- The department also translates three to four articles from English into Cherokee for the Cherokee Phoenix each month, and coordinates the Cherokee language proficiency test for employees wanting to be recognized for their language knowledge. He said about 100 employees have taken the proficiency test. --- “It makes you feel good about our language. As a Cherokee speaker, I like to see more people learning the language and also come in here and talk to us. That’s what we are here for, to try to promote the language,” he said. --- Ross said during a busy week 30 or more people, employees and community members will come to the translation department needing help with a word or reading a document written in Cherokee. The translators also get phone calls from people out of state wanting help with translating phrases, words and even prayers. --- “There’s stories that they have that have been passed down, and they want it translated,” Ross said. “It makes you feel good when you help people like that.” --- Translating for people and programs keeps him “on his toes” and his translation skills sharp. --- “It sharpens your language and writing skills. It just helps you all around to be able to translate,” he said. “Like we say here, ‘not everybody that speaks the language can be a translator.’ It’s a gift, I believe. If they work at it, I think they become translators too, but it’s not easy.” --- The translation staff is also part of the Cherokee Speakers Bureau – a group of about 50 Cherokee speakers from area communities that meet once a month in Tahlequah to discuss Cherokee words, translate English words into Cherokee and fellowship. The bureau is also part of a larger group consisting of Cherokee speakers from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. --- Ross said the most rewarding experience he’s had is translating historic documents written in Cherokee. Some are located at the Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa. And sometimes while translating historic documents, he finds Cherokee words that are no longer used. Ross said the translation department is beginning to use those “lost” words again, and a found word may be one less word the translation group and Cherokee Speakers Bureau has to create. --- “We’re finding a lot of names or towns or communities. They (ancestors) used these words, and now they are all coming back,” he said. --- Ross handles historic documents perhaps hundreds of years old while embracing the latest technology that helps him do his job. The translators use Apple iPhones and iPads and computers with the Cherokee syllabary. He said the staff uses iPads to send emails in the syllabary to other Cherokee language users. --- “That’s pretty neat. This is going to be the future I believe,” he said. --- Despite the efforts being put toward preserving the Cherokee language, the language’s survival still seems uncertain. Ross said his generation is the last generation that speaks the language in everyday conversations. --- He said his generation learned Cherokee from their parents. Cherokee after his generation did not for various reasons, and most of the next generation of speakers will likely come from the Immersion School. --- “We have over 100 children learning the Cherokee language. It’s so wonderful when we go visit them, and we do that a lot. To converse with our kids in our own language is a wonderful thing,” he said. --- He said five years ago that was not possible because only his generation spoke the language. He said he believes more parents today are interested in their children learning the language. --- “Our culture is better off if we speak the language,” he said. “If we continue our immersion school the way it is now, then I don’t think we have to worry about our language dying out. A lot of people say our language is dying out, but here’s an example of our kids showing us, if we teach them, they will learn.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org ---  918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Northeastern State University students have an opportunity to learn about the evolution of the Cherokee language from its inception in handwritten syllabary to today’s technology by taking the new Cherokee Language Technology course. --- “It’s a class where we’re introducing the history of the syllabary,” said co-instructor Joseph Erb. “To the handwritten, to the typeface, to how you can use it in social media; wiki’s, blogs, Google searches and the different writing styles and abilities to be able to do internet usage of the syllabary. Most of the other classes focus on how to learn a language; we focus on where you can use it online, so, text messaging and such.” --- The course is also instructed by Cherokee citizen Roy Boney Jr. --- Erb and Boney both work for Cherokee Nation Education Services where they focus on language technology. --- The elective course started this summer and counts for language elective credit and technology elective credit. --- The idea for the class was born after Boney, Erb and Dr. Leslie Hannah, director of the Cherokee studies and language programs at NSU, were discussing Boney and Erb’s latest project, which was putting Google maps in Cherokee. --- “…They said ‘wouldn’t it be great if we could teach students how to do this.’ And from that seemingly innocent little comment right there this class was born,” Hannah said. --- Students in the Cherokee Language Technology class begin the semester by discussing how the Cherokee writing system has changed in style and font over the years. The class then learns what social media applications support the Cherokee language, such as Facebook and Google. --- “We haven’t gotten to that point yet but we’ll go over how to do Google searches, change languages, deal with the idea of localization, which means turning your computer operating systems into Cherokee,” Erb said. --- The promotion of the course has been word of mouth throughout the NSU community since its still considered a new class. It currently has seven students for the fall semester. --- “I saw this class as an opportunity to learn more about the language, and I’m interested in becoming literate in reading the syllabary without looking at the phonetics, and I thought this would help with that,” said Brooke Hudson, NSU junior and former Miss Cherokee. “I know it’s not only going to help with that but I know it’s going to help with getting that out to more people where they don’t have to go take a class; they can do it in the comfort of their own home. --- “I also want to make other people more aware of the Cherokee language and about the syllabary and how often it can be used.” --- The class is taught at the NSU Seminary Hall, which was built in 1890 as the Cherokee Female Seminary, and the location is more than just a class site, Hannah said. --- “I’ve sat in on a few classes myself listening to how the technology has developed from the pen or quill, and we can see that as we look back at the history of this building right here – Seminary Hall,” Hannah said. “It was 160 years ago when it was cutting edge technology with the quill, or the pen, and now we’re teaching the cutting edge technology of the 21st century in the same building.” --- Hannah said the class has gained a lot of interest not only from NSU students but from students in different countries such as Wales, the United Kingdom, and China. --- “Word is spreading, not just here in town, not just here in Cherokee county, in Cherokee country, but worldwide,” he said. “We’re getting on the world stage by using this technology, showing the world that our language is alive and well and prospering and its thriving right here in Seminary Hall. This is ground zero for Cherokee language preservation and we are spreading it to the world.” ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org • 918-453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Tahlequah resident Sidney Kimble was crowned the new Miss Cherokee 2011-2012 at the Miss Cherokee Leadership Competition on Aug. 27 at the Cornerstone Fellowship Church in Tahlequah. As the new Miss Cherokee, she will represent the tribe throughout the year as an ambassador. --- “To be chosen, it’s an honor I cannot express how much gratitude I feel,” Kimble said. “I don’t even have the words to describe what it means to me that the Nation trusts me enough to hold this title.” --- Kimble, 19, is a sophomore at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, and is considering a major in psychology. --- “I’ve always had an interest, a strong heart for helping those in need,” she said. “It’s a very important characteristic for young people to have and even older people.” --- Her platform during the competition was the “importance of community involvement.” --- She added that winning the competition would give her a way to give back to her community and her tribe. --- “I plan to help by going out not only to big communities, but smaller communities as well and give young kids the opportunity to see that they can accomplish their dreams just as I have,” she said. --- Kimble is the daughter of Erb and Edna Kimble. --- As a high school student, Kimble was involved in several organizations and held leadership roles. She was the president of her high school senior class, a member of the National Honor Society, a member of Cherokee Club and was chosen for Who’s Who Among Native American Students. --- Kimble is actively involved in sports and volunteers in her community. --- “Throughout some point in your life somebody has given something to you so it’s important to give back to them. That’s a community,” she said. “My definition of a community is lending a helping hand when somebody needs it.” --- Kimble and five other contestants were judged by a panel of experts in several categories, including interviewing skills, platform presentation, cultural presentation, social skills, tribal knowledge and their use of the Cherokee language. --- According to Cherokee Nation Communications, Kimble demonstrated her leadership abilities during the competition by speaking Cherokee throughout her entire introduction, focusing on community involvement during her platform presentation and demonstrating to the audience and judges how to make corn husk dolls. --- Kimble will receive a $3,000 scholarship and will serve as a goodwill ambassador and messenger to promote the government, history, language and culture of the Cherokee people, according to CN Communications. --- Jaime Dry, 21, of Locust Grove was selected as first-runner up and will receive a $2,000 scholarship. Dry is the daughter of Johnny and Flora Dry. She is a senior at NSU and majors in American Indian Studies. Her platform was “encouraging education in both culture and academics.” --- “It’s important for Native American youth to succeed both culturally and academically,” Dry said. “So that they can go out to anywhere in the world and succeed and maintain their tribal identity.” --- Candice Byrd, 22, of Tulsa was second runner-up and will receive a $1,000 scholarship. She is the daughter of Joe Byrd and Suzanne Moore. She just recently graduated from Oral Roberts University in Tulsa where she majored in Drama Television and Film. Her platform for the competition was “cultural preservation.” --- “I chose it because I recently attended a language conference and I just really saw the importance of preserving the culture…it just really hit home for me. I thought also that I had a good presentation to tie in with that platform,” she said. --- Her presentation was a hymn sung in Cherokee. --- Kimble will make her first public appearance as Miss Cherokee during the State of the Nation Address Sept. 3 at the 59th Cherokee National Holiday. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org • 918-453-5560

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – A new bronze statue graces the grounds of Sequoyah High School in front of the school’s gymnasium. --- Cherokee/Pawnee artist Daniel HorseChief created the approximately 11-foot tall statue titled “The Seeker.” It was installed at the school on Aug. 24 without fanfare but an official dedication ceremony for the statue will be held later. --- HorseChief is also responsible for the nine-foot tall Sequoyah statues that sit on the campuses of NSU and SHS. He also recently created “Resurgence,” a stickball statue that sits in the atrium of the Cherokee Heritage Center. --- “This one actually came before all of those, even before the Sequoyah piece (2009). It was actually my first large commission, but it’s been put on hold off and on. It’s been four years coming,” he said. --- He added finding a place for the statue at SHS and an injury delayed him finishing “The Seeker.” --- The statue is composed of four figures and each one symbolizes something different, he said. --- The person lying at the bottom of the statue looking worn and beaten could symbolize a person who didn’t make it to Indian Territory during the removal of tribes from the southeastern United States or someone who has been defeated in life, HorseChief explained. --- The second figure from the bottom represent a person’s failures and them fighting through their obstacles while the third figure is “actively and aggressively” trying to block the progress of the warrior who is fighting to survive or overcome obstacles. --- “He could represent the more demanding obstacles, the last obstacles that you have to overcome,” he said. --- The third figure also represents anger and each figure represents an emotion, he said. --- “The main (top) figure, he represents victory or triumph…he represents literally attaining your goal,” he said. “I wanted this for all Native people. We all have similarities. We all have similarities, and we all have personal obstacles and friends that we’ve lost, love ones, so I wanted to show that.” --- The struggles represented could be drug and alcohol abuse, mental and physical struggles and obstacles created by society, HorseChief explained. --- “There are so many things they could represent,” he said. --- The statue was originally meant for the gymnasium’s atrium, which HorseChief said called for a scaled down version of the statue. Ultimately, he rejected the four-foot statue because he believed it was too small to truly represent his vision. --- “It looked too small, and I’m glad it worked out that way because moving outside makes it stand out more,” he said. --- HorseChief also had a hand in determining how the base would look. It is a seven-sided base to represent the Cherokee Nation’s seven clans. The base will have lights to illuminate the figure at night, and HorseChief has asked the CN to landscape the area around the statue and plant pine trees. --- On a personal note, HorseChief said the statue could also represent his personal struggles before he became a full-time artist. As a comparison to where he life was while he was in college compared to his life now as a successful artist, he said in college he was voted by his friends as most likely to die first among his friends. --- “With God’s help it’s turned completely around, and I have a great family. I love my people—all of my people. It’s only with his (God’s) help that I’m here standing,” he said. “It’s been a learning process, and I’ve been corrected a lot, but I’m glad. I just feel so fortunate, it’s like a dream, to be able to get a chance like this.” ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org • (918) 207-3961

PARK HILL, Okla. – It’s as it should be in the Cherokee Heritage Center’s Ancient Village because the Cherokee language is being spoken and heard daily. --- Village tour guides J.D. Ross and Steven Daugherty, both fluent Cherokee speakers, use the language to explain the culture and traditions showcased in the village while using their first language. --- This is the second year the men are serving as Cherokee-speaking tour guides. --- Ross, of the Greasy Community in Adair County, said he enjoys speaking Cherokee and teaching others the language but finds it unfortunate that not many Cherokee-speaking people visit the village. --- “Since we do most of these tours in English, it’s just passing some history on, how the Cherokee people lived back in the 1700s. That’s the century we are concentrating on right now,” he said. --- He added that he and Daugherty take time to share Cherokee beliefs, traditions and the “old ways.” --- Ross said some visitors want translations of English phrases, and the guides try to accommodate them, consulting with each other to ensure the translation is correct. --- Visitors from around the world visit the Ancient Village, Ross said, with some relating to Cherokee customs and traditions because of similarities to their own traditions or customs. --- “Sometimes we talk to them and just kind of compare notes,” he said. “Some linger back and kind of give us of little history of their heritage and their background.” --- Daugherty, of the Bell Community in Adair County, said he welcomed the chance to return to the village to serve as a guide. He too wishes more Cherokee speakers would visit so that he and Ross could converse with them. --- He said he does not mind helping non-Cherokee speakers who ask for translations. But he emphasized the guides are not able to spend time attempting to translate English names to Cherokee. --- Daugherty said he wants visitors to know two things before they leave the village: how Cherokee people lived in the 1700s and that the language is still spoken. --- Recently, the village was re-configured to reflect Cherokee life in 1710 rather than the 1600s as in previous years. There are plans to expand the village and hire more villagers to staff it, possibly within the next year. --- A grant from the International Museum of Library Studies in Washington, D.C., helped get the language tours started, said Ancient Village Supervisor Tommy Wildcat. --- “We thought it was very important to continue with the language tours,” he said. --- He added that he thought it was important to rehire Ross and Daugherty because of their experience. Wildcat said the two guides are now more comfortable in their roles, easily entertain visitors and a valuable part of making the Ancient Village more authentic for visitors. --- “It’s been a great success because we have a lot of people experiencing the Cherokee language,” he said. --- Wildcat said the tours would continue through September. An introductory language tour is available at regular admission every Tuesday through Saturday at 1:30 p.m. For fluent Cherokee speakers and Cherokee language students, a complete and complimentary immersion tour can be reserved between Tuesday and Saturday. Tours are 30-45 minutes long. --- Ross and Daugherty guide visitors through the village, stopping at nine stations where they or other villagers demonstrate basket making, bow and arrow making, the stickball game, flint knapping and the Cherokee blowgun. The guides also explain the Cherokee stomp dances and how the dances are performed. --- Wildcat said for 44 years the Ancient Village has been sharing Cherokee culture with the world, but more importantly, it serves as a classroom for young Cherokee people to get hands-on training in how to make traditional Cherokee tools such as bows and arrows, blowguns and darts, arrowheads, baskets and pottery. Some former students have become award-winning artists and pass on the knowledge they learned as villager. --- “Many have come through here learning these unique traditions perpetuated here by the villagers,” Wildcat said. --- For more information, call 918-456-6007, ext. 6148, or email Susan Cro at susan-cro@cherokee.org. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org • 918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – A gem with ties to the Cherokee Phoenix went untouched for weeks on eBay before Cherokee researcher Dusty Helbling purchased it. And in January, he gave it to the Phoenix staff. --- “I got it, mainly because nobody realized what it was,” Helbling said. --- The piece is an artist proof titled “Sequoyah and the Phoenix” depicting Cherokee syllabary creator Sequoyah against a backdrop of the Cherokee Phoenix logo in shades of blue, red, black and brown. The Cherokee Phoenix is spelled below in embroidered syllabary characters. Under the proof is the title, the French words “bon a tirer” meaning “ready for press” and the artist name Phillip M., though the last name is unclear. --- Helbling’s discovery came about after searching for Cherokee-related items on eBay. --- “This was a one-of-a-kind artist proof that was on the Internet auction,” he said. “It was on for quite a while. They had one auction and nobody bid on it. They lowered the price by half. I thought it was going to go for quite a bit more than I could afford, but I was able to obtain it.” --- Though Helbling doesn’t know much about the proof’s origins, he does know the artist worked for a Georgia company. --- “The artist had started to make (the proof) but the company went bankrupt before they got to make any prints, so this is the only one in existence,” he said. --- Helbling drove from Ozark, Arkansas, to gift the piece. He had it framed and engraved as a way to honor John Foster Wheeler, who was one of the first printers of the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper. --- Wheeler was born in 1808 and began his involvement in the newspaper industry through an apprenticeship in Huntsville, Alabama, in 1822. The experience put him in contact with Isaac Harris, and in 1828 the two men became the first printers of the Cherokee Phoenix newspaper. While Harris eventually left after differing with Editor Elias Boudinot, Wheeler continued. --- He saw the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation clash more than once over treaties and land rights, including the 1835 incident in which Georgia authorities destroyed the paper’s printing equipment. Later that year, Rev. Samuel Worcester, who had moved to Indian Territory, arranged a printing shop at Union Mission, which was north of Fort Gibson, and asked Wheeler to be his printer, making him the first printer in the territory. --- “Every turn, the guy was involved in history,” Helbling said. “That’s why I wanted to honor him as the first printer at the Cherokee Phoenix and also the first one in Indian Territory.” --- Helbling gave the proof to the Phoenix in part because of his love of history. The son of a professional golfer, Helbling grew up creating history of his own. He was the first 5-year-old in the history of golf to have a hole-in-one and was involved with the Professional Bull Riders in the 1940s and 1950s. --- Helbling said he is of Cherokee descent through his great-great-grandfather, which sparked his interest in Cherokee culture. He has spent much time researching the Cherokee people and visiting campsites along the Trail of Tears route in Arkansas and Oklahoma. --- His appreciation for Cherokee culture made gifting the proof an easy decision. --- “I just thought (the proof) belongs here, and I decided to purchase it and get it all set up with the engraving done to have it up here where it really should be,” Helbling said. --- The proof now resides in the Phoenix’s main office. Anyone with information regarding the artist or the proof’s origin can call 918-453-5269.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Twenty-nine year-old Cherokee Nation citizen Steve Brickey, a professional calf roper, has competed in rodeos since about age 6. His drive to compete comes from a deep-rooted family tradition. --- “I grew up in Rocky Ford, about 10 miles north of Tahlequah. My grandpa roped and got me started roping when I was 5 or 6 years old. I rode horses my whole life,” he said. “I just rope everyday. I mean it’s my living. I mean that’s what I do. That’s what I work at. I get up every day and look forward to roping. I like my job.” --- Brickey competed in junior, high school and college rodeos and is now roping calves professionally. --- “I love it. It’s in my heart. It’s my passion. I mean I love the western heritage and I want my kids to do it. My wife, she runs barrels, and you know it’s just in my blood,” he said. “I get to rope and do something I love. I don’t think I’ve ever had a job that I loved besides roping. I can’t look forward to going and mowing the grass or something like that. I love saddling up and roping calves.” --- Brickey’s main rodeo horse is M&amp;M, a 14-year-old quarter horse bred from Doc O’Lena, an American quarter horse that was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1997. --- “He is outstanding in my opinion. I’ve had a lot of people try to buy him off me for lots of money. I’ve had him two years. He’s unbelievable. You don’t have to worry about him doing his part because it’s going to be done,” he said. “He scores so good, like in the box, and he can run. His strongest point is he can stop so hard. So he can make a stronger calf better once I rope him.” --- Brickey also rides four to five other horses while roping daily just to keep him and the horses in shape. --- Over the years, Brickey has won more than 20 saddles at junior rodeo, made the national high school finals and college national finals twice, and in 2007, won the International Professional Rodeo Association’s world title. --- “Then I just worked my way up. Then the next year I won the Prairie Circuit, which is the PRCA (Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association). I won that in 2008 and I’ve just been going strong ever since,” he said. --- In 2012, Brickey won the tie down calf roping event at the Indian National Finals rodeo in Las Vegas and plans to return this year. However, in 2014, Brickey suffered a serious foot injury. --- “I was roping and stepped off a horse and it was turned completely sideways, so I didn’t get to rope for about nine months. I was on the couch, so I figured I better take care of myself a little bit better so I could rope,” he said. “You got to stay fit in my event, the tie down roping, because you got to jump off your horse, you got to run and flank a calf. I go to the gym, try to, in the mornings and try to stay fit. There’s guys doing it professional until they’re 45, 46. They’re kind of on the downhill slide. It really becomes harder then, you know. I’m just trying to stay fit, take care of myself.” --- After being injured, Brickey said he “wasn’t going to take anything for granted.” --- “I mean I’m going to work, put out the effort, and just do my best,” he said. --- Brickey was scheduled to compete at several rodeos in January and February hoping to earn a spot in The American Rodeo on Feb. 28 at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, for a chance to win $1 million. --- “Not every day you get to rope for a million,” he said. “I’ve traveled pretty hard rodeoing. You win a lot, but it takes a lot of money to get up and down the road. I’ve got a lot of help this year hopefully it turns out for the best.”

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen and chef Don McClellan stepped out of his comfort zone July 24 to compete in an Iron Chef-style competition as part of the 2011 “Living Earth Festival” at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. --- The annual Washington, D.C, festival celebrates Native contributions to protecting the environment, promoting sustainability and using indigenous plants for health and nutrition. --- McClellan, 34, originally of Nowata, said he was invited to compete by his mother Carolyn McClellan, who is the NMAI assistant director of community and constituent services. --- “With my education and experience, she thought it would be a great opportunity for me to come to D.C. and showcase all my talent,” McClellan said. --- His competition was Chef Richard Hetzler, the executive chef for the NMAI’s Mitsitam Café, who won the 2010 inaugural competition. --- McClellen has been a chef for 17 years and is the executive chef at Atria Vista del Rio in Albuquerque, N.M. He describes his dishes as “flavorful New Mexican.” --- He said he prefers to keep his preparations simple and flavorful and that his Southwestern style meshed well with the competition’s ingredients of corn, beans and squash – the traditional “Three Sisters” among Native farmers. --- He said having worked with the main ingredients for the past six years as a chef in Albuquerque prepared him the competition. He also said he was able to use the derivatives of corn, beans and squashes in addition to the actual ingredients. --- “I can use squash blossoms as opposed to using zucchini or yellow squash…Corn tortillas would constitute use of the corn,” he said before the competition. “It’s going to be challenging for the simple fact that corns, beans and squash have to be in each dish.” --- For the competition, each chef and his assistants had to prepare two appetizers, three entrees and two desserts using the main ingredients. They also had fresh salmon, duck and buffalo meat available. --- McClellan said creating dessert pastries is not one of his strengths and that he was concerned about his desserts. To prepare for the competition, he said he ate New Mexican-style food, read cookbooks and studied various ways “the Three Sisters” can be prepared. --- He said one of the strengths he brought to the competition was his ability to flavor foods to make them multi-dimensional in taste. He takes pride, he said, in flavoring and seasoning food so that his customers don’t feel the need to flavor it after it reaches their tables. --- The competition was judged on taste, color and presentation and included a time limit. The chefs had one hour for prep work and one hour to prepare their dishes before serving. --- The competition was held in the museum’s outdoor amphitheater, and McClellan said during the competition the temperature was around 102 degrees, with a heat index of about 115 degrees. --- He said he knew he had to focus in the heat and “cook with his heart” and that he was capable of winning because he had a good menu. --- “It’s an opportunity I don’t want to walk away from and say, ‘oh well, I could have done this or I should have done this.’ I want to leave it all out there in the competition,” he said. --- Judgment was handed down by a group of local chefs. The panel consisted of Scott Drewno, executive chef at “The Source by Wolfgang Puck” and last year’s Washington, D.C., Chef of the Year; Brian Patterson, Hetzler’s opponent from 2010; and Pati Jinich, executive chef at D.C.’s Mexican Cultural Institute and host of the cooking show “Pati’s Mexican Table.” --- A report from the competition states McClellan was the crowd favorite. However, he lost by one point, 629-628. --- McClellan said he “loved the competition,” networking and getting out of his “comfort zone” and believes it will help his career. --- He said it was a learning experience and that it confirmed he could keep up with the “big boys.” --- “I know that I can cook, and I’ve been doing it for a long time.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Foundation and site work started in early June for the Cherokee Veterans Center, and Cherokee Nation officials say they expect the building to soon rise at the W.W. Keeler Tribal Complex. --- CN Human Services Group Leader Norma Merriman said contractors recently performed foundation and site work for the center. But because its construction is not a usual build, Merriman said she was uncertain what would come next, saying only “we go up from there.” --- “This is the most interesting build you’ll ever be involved in probably. It’s taken a long time. It will take quite a while to finish,” she said. “Our next goal is to get to dry-in, and while we are getting to that point, we’ll be working on the next phase.” --- Dry-in is a term for when a building reaches the point where it is fully enclosed and safe from precipitation. --- Merriman said the building of the center is a “ga-du-gi” project, meaning it will rely on community volunteers for most of the work, donations of funds and building supplies, as well as CN funding. --- Because there are so many factors for completing the building, including weather, she said CN officials are not giving a final completion date. --- Volunteers had pledged 29,000 volunteer hours during a three-year period. Merriman said she is uncertain about the commitment of some people who volunteered nearly three years ago when the project was first announced. There are likely not enough volunteers for the project, but Merriman said there are never enough volunteers for a construction project like the vet center. --- “You don’t know until you start getting back with them at the time you need them,” she said. “My feeling is some would have lost their enthusiasm because of the time this project has taken. That’s not a negative; that’s just the way people are.” --- Merriman said she’s confident the project will make the dry-in phase with skilled volunteers before contacting other volunteers to ask if they are still willing to contribute their skills and time. --- Ground was broken for the center in September 2009 next to the Cherokee Warrior Memorial on the Tribal Complex. Human Services has taken the lead for the project because it oversees the CN Office of Veterans Affairs and programs. --- The CN is providing $500,000 for the project and is contributing labor through its programs. --- The cost for the center has risen since initially envisioned three years ago from about $800,000 to approximately $2 million. Building revisions and costs for materials increased in three years, which accounts for most of the increase, Merriman said. --- The 8,700-square-foot building will sit on the site of the former tennis courts that were part of a motel the tribe once operated. Work crews have removed the courts and fenced off a construction area. --- Included in the building will be space for veterans services, counseling offices, a kitchen area, library and community room. A special “Hall of Honor” museum will present the stories of individual Cherokee veterans, and in accordance with Cherokee tradition, the building will face east. --- Merriman said even though the CN is building the veterans center, it is for all veterans. --- “It does not matter if they’re Native or non-Native. Anyone who is a veteran, it is for them and their families,” she said. “Our services for veterans have always been open to any veteran and will continue to be when this building’s built.” --- However, she said some veterans programs have specific funding guidelines and may not be available to everyone. --- People willing to volunteer to help build the Cherokee Veterans Center can call Rogan Noble at 918-453-5694 or visit http://veteranscenter.cherokee.org. ---  will-chavez@cherokee.org • 918-207-3961

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation Emergency Medical Service officials offer a free weekly cardiopulmonary resuscitation/first aid class at the EMS building located at Bald Hill Road and 62 Highway, just north of the Tribal Complex. --- EMS paramedic Mark Bighorse said he conducts a class no matter how big the class size is. One week, he said, he had about 28 people take the class. --- “It depends on what week it is. We have an adult CPR/first aid full class and retraining class. We also have a pediatric first aid/CPR class,” he said. --- CN EMS offers one class per week throughout the year. --- “Once they take class here, it’s through the American Heart (Association). We use their curriculum. It’s a two-year card certification,” Bighorse said. “They should take it, at least review the material every six months to just refresh their memory.” --- Bighorse said CPR has changed over the years. He said that the most significant change is that compressions have been determined to be just as effective if one isn’t comfortable give mouth-to-mouth. --- “Its changed throughout the years…the very first time I took a class back in 1978 there was a different set of numbers for each age group and now they try to standardize everything,” he said. “It’s 30 compressions within 18 seconds and then give two breaths if you need or choose to do so.” --- He said the AHA’s big push is to get as many people the knowledge as possible. --- “They find out at least 70 percent of the population, they don’t take a CPR class, and if they did, if something ever happened there is actually an 80 percent chance of doing some good and getting that person back starting immediate CPR,” he said. --- One of the bigger concerns with many who learn CPR is the fear of catching a disease if one gives mouth-to-mouth. Bighorse said there is a small chance one can contract a disease. --- “HIV is hard to catch, but probably the person if they do catch something it may be like hepatitis B or C if there is blood involved, TB, meningitis. There is always a chance in catching something, and if it’s an immediate family, mouth-to-mouth is preferable. Anybody after that it’s going to be up to them,” he said. --- Tahlequah resident Erika Lloyd works at Toy Chest Learning Center and is required to be certified in CPR and first aid. --- “For licensing, you have to take it. But it also helps you when you have an emergency,” Lloyd said. “If you have taken the training behind you, you don’t panic like you would if you have no training. A lot of times when people get hurt they panic more than they take care of themselves and if they know what they need to do for other people and something happens…so then they will not totally panic.” --- Lloyd said so far she hasn’t had to use her CPR training. --- “I know the basics, but I used it for head injuries, or cuts or scrapes or something, but I haven’t had broken legs and I haven’t had strokes and I haven’t had stopped breathing…so (that’s) nice.” --- She has taken CPR/first aid classes for about 40 years now and said over the years it has become a “whole lot more friendly.” --- “Since they are concentrating on the compressions rather than the mouth-to-mouth breathing more people are likely to try doing it,” she said. ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org ? 918-453-5560

PARK HILL, Okla. – As a young man working in the Ancient Village at the Cherokee Heritage Center, Danny McCarter learned how to make Cherokee blowguns and the darts that are launched from them. --- He shared his story and the Cherokee people’s relationship with river cane during a blowgun-making class May 28 at the CHC. --- McCarter said his Cherokee ancestors also used river cane to cover their dwellings, for flutes, baskets and many other things. --- “It’ll grow 10 to 12 foot long,” he said about local river cane. “The normal size for a blowgun in this area is 7 or 8 foot. An average gun is usually 6 foot.” --- He said blowguns are no longer used for hunting and are mostly used for competitions. --- McCarter is a champion blowgun shooter who has previously won blowgun competitions at the Cherokee National Holiday and the United Keetoowah Band Holiday. --- The most important thing he said he wants to teach his students, if they are Cherokee, is their culture. Student Hokey Mitchell, of Chelsea, is a Cherokee artist who creates beadwork pieces and pucker-toe moccasins. He said he appreciated learning more about how the Cherokee people used river cane and will pass on what he learned, just as he takes time to show others how to make beaded items and moccasins. --- Mitchell said he wanted to learn how to make blowguns so that he could show his children, grandchildren and others how to make them. --- “We need to keep the tradition going. I feel like if we don’t take hold of it and keep going with it we could lose this eventually. I sure don’t want that to happen,” he said. --- Mitchell, a member of the Rogers County Cherokee Association, said he plans to share what he’s learned about blowgun making at a future RCCA youth camp and to use the blowgun and darts he made with McCarter for RCCA blowgun competitions. --- McCarter used hot iron rebar rods to hollow out the river cane stalks he gathered near the Illinois River the morning of the class. He said he prefers to work with green cane as opposed to brown cane that has been dried. --- He heats about 12 inches of the 4-foot rods by placing the ends in a fire. After hollowing out the cane about an inch with a knife, he pulls a piece of rebar out of the fire and begins pushing it through the hollowed out area. He wears a leather glove to hold the cane as he pushes the hot rod in to protect his hand from the intense heat. Steam blows out from the cane as he hits pockets of water in the cane’s membrane. The rod burns through the membrane, and he pushes it through a few more times to smooth the inside of the cane. --- McCarter said he has heard of two ways Cherokee men hollowed out their blowguns in ancient times. One way was to use a sharpened rock or arrowhead attached to a rod to hollow out the cane or they split the cane in half, cleaned and smoothed the inside and then put the cane back together. --- For the darts, he gathers Scottish thistle, dries it out and then ties the thistle bulbs to a stick to prevent them from falling apart. Using a small, wooden skewer or a dart made from the Bois d’arc tree, he ties the thistle bulb to the dart using quilting thread and then allows the thistle to expand by rolling the dart between his hands. The thistle allows the dart to travel farther and more accurately toward its target. --- He said he’s made thousands of darts and that he takes it for granted sometimes and forgets just how difficult it can be for a beginner. --- “It’s like anything else, it takes a lot of practice,” he said. --- McCarter was named a UKB Tradition Keeper in 2006 for keeping blowgun making alive. He has been making blowguns for more than 20 years. --- The blowgun class is one of several hosted by the Cherokee Heritage Center during the spring, summer and fall months in an effort to preserve and promote Cherokee history and culture.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Throughout the Northeastern State University Annual Symposium on the American Indian, new ideas are presented and discussed by guests, instructors and students. This year was the first year a student presented a song she had written in Cherokee. --- “The song is called ‘Jiwonihesdi’ and it’s about me learning my language,” Danielle Culp, NSU junior and former Miss Cherokee, said. “My mom is a speaker, it was her first language and when she married my dad, I didn’t have the opportunity to hear Cherokee in my home. And so I came to college and it was really important to me and so I wrote this song as showing the legacy that she’s passing on to me with the Cherokee language.” --- Culp is majoring in Cherokee cultural studies. --- “She’s been a student of ours in Cherokee language for the last three years,” said NSU Cherokee language instructor Harry Oosahwee. “And the thing that impresses me with some of our young people is how they utilize the language when they learn it. They do things that aren’t just your normal, everyday things with the language. They’re able to do a lot of things. Write poetry, short stories and whatnot. Well Danielle is one of the special students that has been able to write a Cherokee song that she’s written herself.” --- Culp, president of the NSU Native American Student Association, presented the song at Oosahwee’s Cherokee Language Forum April 14 where fluent Cherokee speakers from communities in Oklahoma and North Carolina give the audience a chance to hear and experience the spoken Cherokee language in different dialects. --- “The actual writing process only took about an hour but the hardest thing was putting it to music and that took about two hours because since Cherokee has a syllabary, it was really hard to get each of the syllables to fit the beat and to flow,” Culp said. --- While Culp’s mother, Ellen, helped write the song, Culp’s boyfriend, Alex Cobb, a NSU music major, helped write the music. At the symposium, Cobb played the music on a guitar while Culp sang. --- “It was a really important project to me because singing is what I love to do,” Culp said. “I think it was important for me to take what I love doing and take that with my traditions and my heritage. It was a really good project, it really expressed where my heart is with my people but also with my own interests and making those into one.” --- At the end of the performance, Culp dedicated the song to her mother, who was in the audience. --- “My favorite line is the very last one. It say’s ‘Cherokee is what she spoke first, Cherokee is what I’ll speak last,’” Culp said. “That’s what the whole song is about.” --- (English lyrics) --- A difference I could make it --- A chance would I take it, I don’t know anything --- But I know that I do not want to be stuck here --- I want to do what is right --- I want to learn, I want to teach --- Now I have to go, I have to learn --- I don’t know where I’m going --- I know that this place isn’t it --- I want to learn, I want to speak --- Even if I fail --- I’ll try once more --- I’ll listen whey they speak --- I have much to do, now is the time --- A difference I could make it --- A chance would I take it, I don’t know anything --- Our language is important --- Those who are growing up are important --- It begins in the heart --- Now I have to go, I have to learn --- I don’t know where I’m going --- I know that this place isn’t it --- I want to learn, I want to speak --- Even if I fail --- I’ll try once more --- I’ll listen when they speak --- I have much to do, now is the time --- Cherokee is what she spoke first --- Cherokee is what I’ll speak last --- (Phonetics) --- Diganetliyvsdi eliwus yinigadung --- Utlanvdadehv dvgadvnelis, Tla yagwahnta --- Tla sehno yagwadli ahan agwetilvgi --- Osdaheno agwaduli yagwadvhdi --- Agwadelquasdi awaduli, digadeyosdi --- agwaduli --- Now awanagisdi, daganagis --- Tla yagwahta wigedolv --- Awahtahen tla ahan yig --- Agwaduli digadelquasd, awaduli jiwonisg --- Sehno yaginutlvna --- Sagwu’l yvganeldi --- Gajitvdasdesdi aniwonihv’l --- Squisdiheno yagwadvti, nowiheno atliloga --- Diganetliyvsdi eliwus yinigadung --- Utlanvdadehv dvgadvnelis, Tla yagwahnta --- Gawohnihisdi ulisgedv --- Kalo anatvsg ulisgedv --- Adahnvdo didalenihvsga --- Now awanagisdi, daganagis --- Tla yagwahta wigedolv --- Awahtahen tla ahan yig --- Agwaduli digadelquasd, awaduli jiwonisg --- Sehno yaginutlvna --- Sagwu’l yvganeldi --- Gajitvdasdesdi aniwonihv’l --- Squisdiheno yagwadvti, nowiheno atliloga --- Tsalagi hehno igvyi tsigawonihv --- Tsalagi hehno oni tsiwonihesdi, tsiwonihesdi ---  Click on the audio player below to hear ‘Jiwonihesdi’ by Danielle Culp. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org • (918) 453-5000, ext. 6139

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Thornton Media Inc. has released its latest application, or app, that allows people to learn how to write the Cherokee syllabary on the Apple iPad, iPhone and iPod screens with their fingers. The app is called Writing Cherokee. --- “I know the Cherokee Nation has a mandate to use the syllabary, to bring back the syllabary,” said TMI President Don Thornton. “Myself, I don’t know the syllabary, so I’m using the app myself to learn it. It’s one of the reasons I created it. It’s a good way for the average Cherokee to learn the syllabary.” --- Writing Cherokee consists of audio recordings of the 85-character syllabary, narrated by fluent Cherokee speaker Harry Oosahwee. Users play the sound of the character and see it being written. Then users can practice writing it using a finger on the screen. --- “Well it’s a pretty simple application. It’s hard to write the Cherokee syllabary, so basically on an iPad for instance, and of course we have apps for iPads, iPod and iPhone, but on an iPad for instance, you just select the row and you can select the individual character and play the characters. You hear it spoken by a fluent speaker and you can see it written. The app will write it for you and you can practice by writing on the screen,” Thornton said. “You use your finger and you just practice writing it over and over.” --- The application, which is the first application that allows users to write in Cherokee, was created based on the declining number of Cherokee speakers during the past 30 years. It uses a high-tech approach to teach an ancient language. --- “We’ve wanted to do a writing Cherokee app for a while. We just haven’t had time to do it,” Thornton said. “It’s sort of, I guess, a bit of a no-brainer because the hand-held devices that are out there now sort of tailor made for this type of learning. So it’s something we’ve wanted to do for a while just haven’t had time to do. We just recently got around to doing it.” --- TMI creates custom hi-tech tools to help save endangered indigenous languages. It’s Native-owned and has worked with more than 150 American Indian tribes and Canadian First Nation since 1995. TMI is the only language tool company in the world devoted to Native languages. --- Cherokee Writing is currently available for download worldwide in the App Store and iTunes for $4.99. --- The TMI app is separate from Cherokee font that come standard on many Apple products. ---  tesina-jackson@cherokee.org • (918) 453-5000, ext. 6139

CATOOSA, Okla. – Cherokee mixed martial artist Charlie Wright won his sixth bout Feb. 25 during The Joint’s Extreme Fight Night at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Tulsa. --- Locally trained at Apollo’s Karate in Tulsa, Wright is 6-0 after beating Daniel Flora by unanimous decision during the Extreme Fight Night card. --- Overall, his record consists of one knockout, two submissions and three unanimous decisions. --- Wright said he wrestled in middle and high school, but thought seriously about getting back into shape about two years ago when he joined Apollo’s Karate. --- “I like the self-discipline and all the perseverance it takes,” he said about MMA. --- The 21-year-old amateur fighter has been working at making a name for himself, and his agent and promoter, Dale “Apollo” Cook, said Wright has all the makings of a great athlete. --- “I believe Charlie has the tools to do very well in the sport. He is a good athlete. He is smart and he has courage,” Cook said. “Those are things you cannot teach. Those are weapons you have or you don’t and Charlie has them. You put all that together he is gonna be a hard guy to beat.” --- Cook said if Wright’s goal is to be a professional MMA fighter then he needs to meet every opponent possible that he might meet at the pro level. --- “He progresses and gets better every fight, but its more than that,” he said. “It’s important to face every type of opponent so he can learn how to not let someone beat him. This way he’s not gonna face anything he cannot handle.” --- Cook added that Wright is a “tremendously bright prospect,” but he’s in no hurry to get Wright hurt or discouraged. --- As the young fighter progresses, Cook said he plans to up Wright’s sparring competition and introduce him to the public as the great person he knows Wright to be as well as for Wright’s fighting capability. --- “There is no way to gain confidence than to spar people better than you, and it would be great for people to know more about Charlie the person and not just as a fighter. Then I’ll make him a million bucks,” Cook said laughingly. --- After the fight, Wright said he loved hearing the roar of the crowd. Another thing he said he loves about the sport is the excitement he brings to young fans watching him during the fights. --- “I’d rather them be there and get into legitimate fighting than fighting on the streets,” Wright said. “And (the kids should) know that it’s more of a discipline than an all-out brawl. It’s a lot of training, endurance and perseverance.” ---  jami-custer@cherokee.org • (918) 453-5560

PARK HILL, Okla. – The Cherokee Heritage Center recently received funding that is needed to continue working on its new Ancient Village. --- The Tulsa-based Mary K. Chapman Foundation committed $100,000 to the project that began this past summer. When completed, the new village will consist of 20 wattle and daub structures, 14 interpretive stations and a detailed historic landscape set on four acres of land. --- Wattle and daub is a building material used for making walls, in which a woven lattice of wooden strips called wattle is daubed with a sticky material usually made of some combination of wet soil, clay, sand, animal dung and straw. --- Two new pilot structures, a Cherokee summer and winter home made of wattle and daub and river cane, were recently completed. --- “This is a wonderful Christmas present,” said CHC Executive Director Carey Tilley. “A special thank you is due to (former principal chief) Ross Swimmer for his work on this and very special appreciation is owed to Cherokee Nation citizen Donne Pitman who serves as a (Chapman) foundation trustee for his faith in and enthusiasm for the project.” --- Tilley added that appreciation is due to CN citizen Mary Ellen Meredith for her donation of $5,000 to kick off the Village Endowment Fund. --- The new funding will be combined with a previous commitment of $250,000 from Cherokee Nation Entertainment and an in-kind donation of more than $36,000 from the Boyd Group, an architectural firm, for the village design. --- Architect Charles “Chief” Boyd designed the original ancient village in 1966. --- Overall, the village project is estimated for $1 million, and the first of three phases is expected to be completed this summer. --- “We have some very strong momentum building for raising the necessary funds to complete the new village,” Tilley said. --- Eight house pairs of winter and summer homes, winter and summer council townhouses, an orchard, ball field, gardens and a re-circulating stream are some of the features planned for the new village. Plants and trees important to Cherokee people will also be planted throughout the village, including river cane. --- The permanent, living exhibition will be set in the early 1700s just before increased trade between the Cherokee and their white neighbors brought more non-traditional items into the Cherokee world. --- The working name for the village is Kanusita, which is the Cherokee word for the Dogwood tree. Tilley said the name serves as a placeholder for the type of name that will be given to the new village. --- “We want to get the community of Cherokee speakers involved in the final naming,” he said. --- Tilley said the official name must be Cherokee, be easy for the public to pronounce and spell and follow one of the historical naming patterns for Cherokee towns. --- Professor Alfred Vick of the College of Environmental and Design at the University of Georgia has assisted the CHC with plans for the new village. He said the previous village was not an ideal location to build a historically accurate Cherokee village because of the topography was not flat, especially for the creation of a plaza. --- So land adjacent to the current village and an area used for overflow parking will be used for the new village that includes a flat area for a plaza. --- From May to September, the village would have a minimum of 14 interpreters, dressed in a blend of deerskin and other natural materials as well as period trade cloth, to demonstrate traditional Cherokee skills, play traditional Cherokee games and share traditional Cherokee stories. In addition, costumed guides will relate events from Cherokee history while re-creating a picture of everyday Cherokee life 300 years ago. --- Tilley said he expects the larger and more accurate village will boost regional tourism, and with the increase in visitation, provide an opportunity to more richly portray the Cherokee story.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – In the “old gym” at Sequoyah Schools, familiar sounds can be heard – shoes squeaking on the hardwood floor, a ball being dribbled up and down the court and the swish of the net as a ball goes through it. --- And then…“Osda, osda!” The Cherokee word for good. --- No, this isn’t some run-of-the-mill basketball game. This game involves one of the Cherokee Language Immersion Program’s basketball teams. And just like the rest of the LIP, basketball is taught exclusively using the Cherokee language. --- “Everything goes hand-in-hand, and we’re just trying to provide more opportunities for every child at immersion,” said LIP Principal Holly Davis. “All of our activities are in Cherokee, and we hope to just expand on it yearly. We’re looking at something new to add every year.” --- The boys and girls teams are comprised of 19 students in third, fourth and fifth grades. Though the basketball program was formed in 2009, the 2010-11 season is the first the teams competed with area schools. --- “I think it’s a good outlet to use the language out in the community,” said Jeromie Hammer, LIP physical education coach, said. “It teaches the kids about competition, dedication. I think that it gives the language a little action.” --- Jolie Morgan, a fourth grade student on the team, said it can be a little more difficult playing on an all Cherokee-speaking team, but she’s getting used to it. --- “Well, you’ve got to remember not to speak English,” she said. “And sometimes you’re not too sure what they’re saying, but you’ll figure it out.” --- And Morgan isn’t the only one having difficulties with learning the sport in Cherokee. --- “It is hard to speak basketball terminology in Cherokee,” Hammer said. “A lot of the basic actions like jumping and throwing and catching – those sorts of things aren’t hard. But when you get into the sports terminology and the philosophy of sports, it’s definitely a challenge.” --- Jolie’s mother, Candessa Tehee Morgan, said she thinks the skills her daughter is learning on the team are important. --- “I thought it would be a great experience for her because it introduces her to a whole new set of terms,” she said. “She gets to work with the other kids. It’s about teamwork whenever you’re on a basketball team, and I thought that all of those things together were important for her.” --- Davis also said using activities such as basketball is a good way to teach students because it not only gives them a way they can use what they learn in the classroom, but it teaches them skills such as teamwork. --- “When we’re on a ball team, it’s different than being in a classroom,” she said. “We’re learning teamwork. We’re learning how to work with others, which carries right into the classroom.” --- While the boys’ team has struggled for a win this season (0-5 as of press time), the girls’ team is looking to finish strong (4-1 as of press time). --- Regardless of the records, Hammer said he thinks both teams have been successful. --- “I couldn’t be more proud of the kids and the effort they’ve put forth,” he said. “Not only do they practice and they commit to reaching a goal that we’ve all established for ourselves, but they do this along the way adapting the sport into Cherokee – using the language. --- “I told these kids when we played softball before that when we pull up to another school and we compete with another group of kids and we know that we’ve given them a good game and they hear us speak only Cherokee on the field, then we’ve accomplished two major goals. And so that’s what we’re after,” he added.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Andi Gourd of Sallisaw Central High School missed winning the recent Class 2A cross country individual championship by just eight seconds. --- On Oct. 23 in Shawnee, she finished a wet 2-mile course in 12 minutes, 49 seconds to earn second place. Jaylee May of Balko High School won the individual state title finishing in 12:41. --- The tough race conditions didn’t distract Gourd from her goal of finishing in the top 10. --- “It was pretty rough conditions. I tried just to focus on the race. I warmed up for a long time, and then they kept postponing it for five minute intervals,” she said. --- Gourd’s second-place finish was 10 spots better than her 12th-place finish in 2009. She said her initial goal this year was to finish in the top 10, but when she won the regional meet the week before, she began thinking about the championship. --- On Oct. 16, Gourd, who is also part Muscogee Creek, won the regional title at Coweta, finishing the two miles in 12:45. --- “Actually I was pretty confident. I was kind of more determined to do it than anything,” she said. --- To prepare for the cross country season, she said she walked and jogged the courses she knew she would be competing at, which allowed her to visualize each course before competition. --- Next year, she wants to have an even better showing and beat the current state champion. --- “I’d like to at least stay up with her and maybe beat her,” Gourd said. --- Gourd credits her coach Scott Lowe for encouraging her to improve her running times even though he is a basketball coach. She also credits her family for being at her races cheering her. --- The sophomore began running in the fifth grade after joining the Cherokee Nation Wings Program, running 5K distances or 3.1 miles. She was the Wings Spotlight Runner in July 2007. --- “I liked how it’s different age groups running. And it wasn’t really competitive, and you could cheer other people on and better yourself,” she said of Wings. --- After her strong finish to the cross country season, Gourd earned a spot in the annual Arkansas-Oklahoma Dual Cross Country Meet on Nov. 13 in Rogers, Ark.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the country, with a coronary episode occurring every 25 seconds. --- The CDC also states that Native Americans are second highest in heart disease-related deaths. The most common heart disease is coronary heart disease, which is often seen as a heart attack. --- Lyn Behnke, a Cherokee Nation citizen from Tawas City, Mich., said she suffered a heart attack in December 2008. --- “At age 50 I flunked a stress test significantly,” Behnke said. “I didn’t have any symptoms other than being tired. I’m a nurse practitioner, and I’m also a musician as well, so I had a lot of things going on. I figured I was tired because I was busy.” --- She said fatigue and a minor ache in her neck were all the symptoms she experienced. But it turned out she had a mild heart attack. --- “I had a funny little ache in my neck, so I called my primary care provider and said ‘I think I need an MRI of my neck.’ She said ‘you need to look at your (heart health) risk profile. You’re 50 now. Your lifestyle is stressful. You are a little overweight. Your blood pressure is a little up, and I think we should do the stress test.’ So she did and I flunked it spectacularly,” Behnke said. --- A month later, Behnke had triple bypass surgery after doctors discovered artery blockages. --- “I had two 95 percent blockages and a 90 percent blockage in my arteries. So I was just staring a heart attack in the face, but for the grace of God go I,” she said. --- Behnke was fortunate, but some are not. Heart attacks can occur quickly and be intense. However, some occur more slowly with mild pain and discomfort, such as Behnke’s. Those affected are sometimes unsure of what is wrong. --- According to the CDC, some signs of a heart attack are chest discomfort with uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain; discomfort in other upper body areas such as arms, back, neck, jaw or stomach; shortness of breath; and breaking out into a cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness. --- Heart disease is commonly thought of as a man’s disease, but it is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. According to the CDC, women account for nearly 50 percent of heart disease deaths. --- There is also a misconception that the disease is only for older people. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in women aged 65 years and older, but it’s also the third-leading cause of death in women aged 25-44 and the second-leading cause of death in women aged 45-64. --- For men, the average age for a first heart attack is 66 years. Between 70 percent and 89 percent of sudden cardiac events occur in men, according to the CDC. --- For Native Americans, it is important to recognize factors that increase heart disease risks such as arrhythmia, heart failure, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, tobacco use and secondhand smoke. Behnke said the two factors she sees in Native cultures that cause heart problems are getting away from traditional diets and tobacco abuse. --- However, there are ways to prevent heart disease, such as exercising and developing healthier eating habits. --- Behnke, who is a member of WomenHeart – the national coalition for women with heart disease, said there is not a great representation of Native American women and heart disease. --- “So consequently, since we are not in the news and our face isn’t out there. People don’t think about Native women having heart disease, and it’s rampant in our community, particularly with the diabetes and the high blood pressure,” she said. --- Since her surgery, Behnke has become healthier through exercise. She has lost 30 pounds, but said it is a continuing struggle to maintain a healthy lifestyle. --- “I am probably healthier than I have been in years. I haven’t really changed my diet because that was never an issue…I exercise ever day at least six days a week,” she said. “It’s not something you can do for awhile and just quit. I think that’s the biggest challenge. It’s a big struggle. I had an 80 percent lesion (blockage) in my artery and I took it down to 60 percent lesion with exercise. So it makes a huge difference.” --- Behnke said the biggest barrier for most women is finding time to exercise. --- “Grabbing that extra half an hour, you know, having the family put off dinner for an hour. I might be late to a sporting event or dinner, but the exercise comes first.”

Cherokee Nation to expand health info exchange to Tulsa area
05/07/2010 07:13 AM
TULSA, Okla. – The Cherokee Nation is among 47 participants in the Greater Tulsa Health Access Network that will use a 2 million grant to improve patient care by creating better medical information systems. --- Representatives of Greater THAN organizations gathered May 5 to announce the Beacon Community Grant, a technology grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that will be used to develop a community-wide system for sharing patients’ medical records. --- According to a White House press release, the sharing of electronic health records should lead to smarter and lower health care costs to Americans. --- “…doctors across the country will one day be able to coordinate patient care with the stroke of a key or pull up life-saving health information instantly in an emergency,” the release states. --- Melissa Gower, group leader of CN Health Services, said the tribe has been exchanging health information with Greater THAN members for some time and that she is excited CN will be able to extend that sharing to the Tulsa area. --- “We refer so many patients to Tulsa for tertiary care,” Gower said. “It’s going to save us money because now we will be able to access that information through the computer so it will decrease the duplication of tests that are ran and the quality of care will be much more efficient.” --- Tulsa is one of 15 communities nationwide chosen to receive the grant. Each community chosen has set goals that vary depending on certain needs. For example, according to a press release, Tulsa has an “epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes” with the highest rate of cardiovascular disease deaths in the nation. --- Greater THAN members plan to use health information technology resources in the area as a foundation to bring doctors, patients, health facilities and programs together to discover ways to make health care a more efficient process. --- Dr. David Kendrick, acting coordinator for the Greater THAN, said 11 counties in the area would be covered under the grant and that about 1.600 physicians and other health care providers are expected to participate. --- A potential cost savings of 1 million annually was predicted through better monitoring, improved care transitions, increased appropriate referrals for cancer screenings and access to care for those with diabetes. A reduction in preventable hospitalizations and emergency room visits also is expected. --- The three-year grant is also expected to create jobs within the health information technology field.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Born in Muskogee and raised in Stilwell, Cherokee Nation citizen Sandy Garrett was the first woman in Oklahoma to be elected as the state’s superintendent of Public Instruction. --- She is also the only woman to hold a statewide office for five consecutive terms. But in 2009, she announced that she would not seek a sixth term. --- Garrett said it meant a lot to be the State Department of Education’s chief executive officer, to see the things she has seen, to be given the opportunities she has been given and to make a difference. --- She added that being Cherokee has also been important to her having grown up in a highly populated Cherokee community. --- “…I’ve worked with all 39 of our tribes in Oklahoma, but of course, particularly with the Cherokees because I am from eastern Oklahoma and was raised in Adair County, Stilwell, Okla. And being of Cherokee descent and a tribal member, that’s meant a lot to me,” Garrett said. “Coming from that area, I never took that out of my mind in making decisions about children.” --- After graduating from Stilwell High School, Garrett earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Northeastern State University in Tahlequah. She pursued her postgraduate education at the University of Oklahoma in Norman and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University before returning to Muskogee and teaching at Hilldale Schools for 15 years. --- In the late 1980s, Garrett served as secretary of Education for Gov. Henry Bellman, working with him on the state’s education reform movement. From that movement came House Bill 1017, which Garrett said is “the most major reform effort Oklahoma had ever embarked on in education.” The movement and bill are what encouraged her to run for office, she said. --- “…I got the idea that I needed to be state superintendent in order to implement that bill. At that time, that was when I decided to run for office,” Garrett said. --- She initially won the seat in 1990 and again in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006. --- During those five terms, she said she’s helped accomplish several big achievements, including Oklahoma’s technology efforts in education. --- “When I came into office there were rotary dial phones and electric typewriters,” she said. Garrett added that early childhood development is another area she helped grow in Oklahoma. “I think there are other things that I’m quite proud of, but these were things that I knew that were very important and would be very important to Oklahoma future. We are number one in the nation (in early childhood development), and we are also number one in the nation in our teacher of the year program.” --- Yet in August 2009, Garrett announced that she would not seek re-election for a sixth term. Her 20 years as superintendent of Public Instruction was set to end Jan. 10. --- “Twenty years is quite enough. It was time to move on and do something else, and I will be very supportive of the next person’s efforts.” --- She said her plan now is to relax and maybe write. Garrett said she is also interested in charity work, particularly foster care. --- “I know Oklahoma is number one in the nation of children in state custody through foster care, and I think that we need to tend to that terrible fact,” she said.

Cherokee language immersion school teacher retires
06/30/2010 08:31 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Reba Rodgers speaks the Cherokee language fluently, and for the past four years she’s shared that knowledge with the next generation of Cherokee speakers.Rodgers retired June 25 from her job as a first grade teacher at the tribe’s Cherokee Language Immersion Program. But her recent retirement is actually her second time retiring as a teacher.“She taught 24 years in the first grade at Marble City. Then she decided, ‘I want to go into retirement,’” said Rebecca Drywater, language project supervisor.The 65-year-old Rodgers was retired from Marble City Schools in Sequoyah County for nearly three years before applying at the immersion school, after much coaxing by her sister-in-law and son.“My sister-in-law was already working here,” Rodgers said. “They needed a first grade teacher and they started asking everybody if they knew anybody who wanted to teach. She mentioned me and that I was retired. But I said, ‘no, I don’t think I want to.’”After several discussions with her son, Cherokee Phoenix Senior Reporter Will Chavez, Rodgers came out of retirement to teach her native language. So for the past three years and 11 months, she has driven 45 minutes to Tahlequah from Marble City five days a week to teach Cherokee.“It was just amazing to hear those kids talk Cherokee when I was sitting in the classroom,” she said. “I thought, ‘what am I going to do? They already know how to talk.’ But I really enjoyed it. I just wish I could do more.”Rodgers graduated from Northeastern State University in 1979 with a bachelor’s degree in education. In 2008, she expanded her education by becoming a certified teacher in Cherokee literacy. The language comes easy for her because she grew up speaking Cherokee and learned English as a second language.“I had to learn English when I started school,” she said. “That’s what I tell these kids, but they don’t believe me.”Now retired again, Rodgers is looking forward to activities she hasn’t had time for such as quilt making.“My sisters and I were talking, and I think we’re going to start making quilts whenever we can,” she said. “Momma used to do it, and we used to help her. We decided to pick it back up and see what we could do.”Rodgers also said she wants to baby sit her 9-month-old grandson and travel. “Will said we might travel a little bit,” she said. “We like to travel.”As for the job she’s leaving, she said she feels the immersion program and other CN language initiatives are moving in a positive direction.“I think they can (revitalize the language) if the people would really want to learn,” she said. “They have to have their minds set on it. It’ll take a lot of work for them to learn. But I think it’s good that they’re trying.”Though she’d like to do more, she said she knows it’s time to take a break.“I just feel like it’s time,” Rodgers said. “I’m wore out and tired all the time. I think it’s (immersion program) a great thing. The kids are so easy to teach. They just pick it up so quickly. Just to hear them talk, it’s really good to hear them talk.”

PARK HILL, Okla. – On Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, more than a thousand students from schools within the Cherokee Nation jurisdiction experienced what Cherokee culture was like from 1600-1710 by in the Cherokee Heritage Center’s Ancient Cherokee Days. --- “Our mission at the Cherokee Heritage Center is to promote, preserve and teach Cherokee history and culture, and this is the perfect venue to do that for this age group,” said CHC Education Director Tonia Weavel. “The best way is to let them participate. Let them see it. Let them smell the fires. Let them take part what was once our daily life.” --- For the past nine years, the CHC has hosted the Ancient Cherokee Days every autumn at its Ancient Village to show students how Cherokees once lived before European intrusion. --- “It’s one of the most important things I do at the Heritage Center,” Weavel said. “In order to relay and educate school children about Cherokee culture, and to do it in a way that they enjoy and that they can participate in, I think it’s one of the most fundamental things that the heritage center does.” --- The CHC staff, several Talking Leaf Job Corps students and members of the Cherokee Nation Education Corporation took part in running this year’s event. --- From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and for an admission of $5, students in grades kindergarten through 12 from area schools got to participate in Cherokee cultural games such as blowgun shooting, stickball, marbles and chunkey. --- “We try to choose activities that are relevant to life in 1710,” Weavel said. “Recently our village changed time frames from the early 1600s to 1710, which is the time frame we’ve opted to show the Ancient Village lifestyle.” --- Other events students participated in were pottery making, basket weaving, food grinding, face painting and drawing. Other cultural stations introduced children to the Cherokee language, Cherokee ceremonies clan relationships and storytelling. Sequoyah High School students, who performed the Cherokee legend “Why the Possum’s Tail is Bare”, performed one of the stories told this year. --- “I find that being part of the Ancient Cherokee Days is very important for students because they come from miles around and not only do they learn about Cherokee cultural, Cherokee crafts but they also get to see a Cherokee story that’s entertaining and funny,” SHS drama teacher Amanda Ray said. “It’s just a good experience for students all over the place.”

NSU students celebrate American Indian Heritage Month
11/09/2010 07:00 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Native American students attending Northeastern State University met Nov. 1 at the Cherokee Courthouse square for a “moc walk” to commemorate National American Indian Heritage Month. --- In moccasins and barefooted, the students walked four blocks from the square to the NSU Centennial Plaza where they spoke about the month’s significance and shared the times and dates of events planned for November. --- Asa Lewis, who is Kiowa/Cherokee and the interim student coordinator for the NSU Center for Tribal Studies, took part in the walk. She also advises four of the six Native American organizations on campus – Alpha Pi Omega, a Native American sorority; the Native American Student Association; Indian University Scholar Society; and the NSU American Indian Science and Engineering Society. --- She said the Native groups formed a committee to plan events for November, with each organization agreeing to coordinate at least one activity. Phi Sigma Nu, a Native American fraternity, and American Indian Business Leaders members also participated in the walk that was organized by Alpha Pi Omega. --- “We wanted to start the month off honoring all tribes, where we’ve come from, how far we’ve come. We wanted everyone to wear their moccasins throughout the day, and when we came together for the ‘moc walk’ we wanted them to wear their traditional wear,” Lewis said. “We start here (courthouse) because it’s something from our past and we end up at Centennial Plaza, which is symbolic of how far we’ve come.” --- A fry bread-eating contest sponsored by NASA and a stickball game also were held the first week of November. --- On Nov. 18, NASA students are slated to host a storyteller event with four local storytellers from 9:30 a.m. to noon in the meeting room of the Place Where They Play on the Sequoyah Schools campus. The following day Native IUSS students are set to host area grade school students for arts and crafts presentations at NSU. The importance of a college education also will be discussed. --- At Centennial Park, student Kryste Benge, Muscogee Creek/Choctaw, read a statement about what National American Indian Heritage Month is, how it started and what the month means to her and her Alpha Pi Omega sisters. She said at one time this country’s Indian heritage was celebrated for only one day and then a week. The many contributions by Native Americans could not be honored in one day or one week, she said, so in 1990 President George H.W. Bush established November as National American Indian Heritage Month. --- She also mentioned the successes tribes are having preserving their cultures and languages, including the Cherokee Nation with its success in preserving its language through a Cherokee language degree program at NSU and its immersion school. --- “It’s not just the Cherokees. There are other tribes across the nation that have had similar successes,” said Benge, who graduated from Sequoyah and will graduate from NSU in May with a degree in political science. --- She said while growing up in Tahlequah her Native heritage did not hinder her from achieving her goals, but helped her. --- “Many Native Americans who do enter college have life challenges that come their way, but because of how we are raised with the core values of our families, we persevere as Native people and also as students,” she said. --- She said the values she learned and the “chain of excellence” carried by her and fellow Native students need to be passed down to the following generations.

Fire threats increase in winter months
01/14/2011 06:51 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – According to the U.S. Fire Administration, the winter months mean increased fire possibilities in people’s homes. Nationally, December is the highest month for residential building fires, with January, February and March following. --- Aaron Garrett, Tahlequah Fire Department captain, said winter is when his department begins receiving calls from people complaining of smelling smoke. --- “This season usually we start looking at the ‘I smell smoke’…you know, from people just turning the heaters on,” he said. --- He added that contrary to national figures, Tahlequah sees most of its house fires in January and February. Generally, house fires follow a cold snap lasting 10 to 14 days in January or February, such as the recent years’ ice storms, Garrett said. --- “When we have a cold snap that lasts 10 to 14 days or longer, people start looking for alternative ways of heating their house,” he said. “You start adding on the space heaters and start worrying about other things and neglect space heaters, or starting to try and stretch space heaters with extension cord or something like that. That’s usually when we run into issues of fires associated with the season.” --- Garrett said it’s important for people to maintain their heating sources. Space heaters are the most common problems the TFD sees, as well as flue fires. He said many people neglect to maintain their flues each year, which poses problems in the winter months. --- “You think about it probably once. ‘Ah, I need to clean that out,’ and then it gets cold and you get busy and people forget about it,” he said. “If you don’t know how to do it, you know it’s going to cost you some money, and I know this time with the economy the way it is, that’s difficult for people to deal with. Some people are concerned with eating let alone heating their homes.” --- A suggestion Garret gives for preparing for the winter months includes not overloading circuits in the home. --- “We have a tendency of exceeding that (the circuits), but we haven’t had a whole lot of issues (in Tahlequah),” he said. “When we use a surge protector it gives us the tendency of ‘oh I can plug six things in this at once and turn them all on at the same time.’ And that is not the case. A surge protector is made, of course, so you can plug six things in and not have to unplug something to plug something else in.”

Cherokee student leads Pride of Oklahoma marching band
11/08/2010 06:59 AM
NORMAN, Okla. – Matt Sumner has fine-tuned his time management and people skills, and his “strutting” skills aren’t bad either. Sumner, 24, is the drum major of the University of Oklahoma’s Pride of Oklahoma marching band and its “corporate identity.” Dressed in his tall white hat and red and white uniform, he performs his signature strut down Owen Field as he leads the 300 Pride members onto the field to the tune of “Oklahoma.” The Bixby resident established himself in the more-than-a-century-old band as a trombone player his freshman year and steadily added volunteer activities to his resume’ during his college career. “This is my first year (as drum major) and I’ve been in the Pride for five years now,” he said. “It’s been a crazy experience going all the way from being a freshman and playing trombone to my senior year now of playing the role as the drum major.”To say Sumner stays busy during college football season is an understatement. Along with a full load of classes, the Cherokee Nation citizen and OU senior rehearses with the band five days a week.But his hectic schedule didn’t just materialize with the arrival of football season. “A lot of it’s summer preparation,” Sumner said. “Working to get physically in shape and to get mentally engaged and make sure you know when that first game happens you’re going to be able to go out here and do it without a problem. There can’t be any sense of doubt.” He has tried out for the drum major role every year he’s been at OU, and his tenacity paid off in his senior year. --- Director of the Pride of Oklahoma Brian Britt said it takes a special individual to be drum major. “The drum major is our living breathing corporate identity,” said Britt, who’s been the director for 10 years. “Our logo has the drum major identity. They have to be the unquestioned leader.”He said Sumner established great relationships during the years with people from different areas of the band. “Over the last couple of years he volunteered to drum major a lot of pep band events, and he was always available and willing to help and go the extra mile and leading those types of things,” Britt said. By volunteering and creating relationships, Sumner built a rapport with the Pride members as he worked on his physical and musical skills, Britt said. “I think it was really all three of those things melded into one that worked out in his favor,” he said. “We really appreciate all the hard work that Matt has put into the job. He’s brought a lot of enthusiasm, and I know the students really respect him, and he’s been an excellent representative for our organization.”Sumner said he’s worked hard to build his leg strength to be able to strut on the field.“Each year it’s gotten better. It takes a lot of leg strength, and you’ve got to be a little flexible in the back but a lot of it’s about the legs,” he said.As he’s leaned back strutting down the field with more than 80,000 people watching, Sumner said things flash though his mind.“When I do a performance it’s like a blur, a dream,” he said. “(I think,) ‘do your best. You can do this.’”The only thing Sumner really grapples with is time. “I love every single moment we have here, and it seems like it just goes so fast. It’s just an incredible experience. That’s been the most challenging thing.”He added that nothing he’s done really compares to his drum major experience. “It’s such an incredible thing to be able to meet so many great people. I get to be exposed to 300 of OU’s talented and brightest individuals every single day, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”

‘Greenway’ concept discussed for Cherokee Nation jurisdiction
10/07/2010 08:14 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation officials met with representatives from the National Park Service, Boy Scouts of America, Oklahoma Scenic Rivers and other organizations Sept. 29 to discuss possibly establishing a “greenway” corridor between U.S. Highway 412 and Interstate 40. --- Greenways provide people recreational areas, community meeting places, educational experiences and natural landscapes as well as historic preservation and beautification opportunities. --- The meeting was held at Camp Egan, east of Tahlequah, and included the Trail of Tears Association, Land Legacy, Nature Conservancy, Save The Illinois River, Saline Preservation Association, Dwight Mission and the Cherokee community organizations Blue Sky Water and Marble City. --- “We envisioned this greenway running all the way from Sallisaw Park near I-40 all the way up to Salina,” said Blue Sky Water President Myra Robertson. “It’s parallel to the (Cherokee Hills) Scenic Byway, and people can get off of the byway and visit. It’s not all written in stone yet. That’s what we are here to do is plan and decide what the greenway will be.” --- Attendees discussed what should be in the greenway, why it is needed and why it would be important for communities within the CN, Robertson said. --- She said Blue Sky Water received a NPS planning grant to get the greenway project off the ground. However, Robertson said for it to succeed people who are interested along the greenway corridor will need to help manage it with the NPS. --- Prior to the Sept. 29 meeting, forums were held in various communities to discuss sites of interest and natural resources communities would have to offer for the greenway. --- “We were trying to piece together a trail. Cherokee Nation mapping has helped with our maps. We’ve had a donation of land already along Sallisaw Creek. Everything has been going and growing,” Robertson said. --- NPS Community Planner Joy Lujan attended the Sept. 29 meeting. She said the NPS River, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program helps organizations and communities across the country with planning for outdoor recreation and natural resource preservation. --- “Last year, we got a request for assistance from Blue Sky Water to help them look at a greenway concept, and it’s grown to be a much bigger idea than we started with,” Lujan said. --- She said “intersecting” interests of the participants would benefit the region. The tribe’s interest, she said, is creating recreational areas where Cherokee people can be active. --- Lujan said greenways not only preserve land for people’s use, they also preserve land for animals to remain in their natural habitats. --- “Our job is to look at existing resources and figure out how to connect them, and that’s what we hope the community will help us do,” she said. “Part of the reason we’re here today is to figure out how we’re going to work together to make it happen.” --- Suzanne Sullivan, CEO of the Vian Community Charitable Trust, said Vian could be an important part of the greenway because it is a “wonderful location and a “doorway” to Sequoyah National Wildlife Refuge, Tenkiller State Park, the Lower Illinois River, Sallisaw Creek and Vian Creek. --- “It’s also the gateway to the Cherokee Nation off of I-40. It’s the best exit to take you straight to Tahlequah,” she said. “I think thinking regionally we need to connect those dots and realize that we are a suburb of Tahlequah and the gateway to the Nation.” --- Sullivan said there is also much Cherokee history associated with the Vian area and western Sequoyah County that could be incorporated into the greenway. --- Robertson said the greenway should complement the 88-mile Cherokee Hills Scenic Byway, which was designated in 2008 in Sequoyah, Cherokee, Adair and Delaware counties. The designation made available federal funding and grants to increase tourism for those counties. --- “Personally, I feel like it (greenway) gives people an opportunity to build economic development in some of the rural areas and rural communities without changing the way that we live or without changing our natural resources,” Robertson said.

08/16/2010 07:07 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – In collaboration with Sole Nation Health, Cherokee rap artist, actor and entrepreneur Litefoot has become the first Native American celebrity to develop and produce a personal brand of sneakers to accommodate diabetics. “A lot of orthopedic shoes are not the coolest looking shoes, and some of the young people who should be wearing those shoes don’t because it’s not a cool shoe,” Litefoot said. “I think this shoe will give them the opportunity to wear something that’s really cool and that they won’t be embarrassed of, and it also speaks to their Native American heritage.” ---  MORE INFORMATION ---  The sneaker will be released Oct. 11, and are available for purchase online at www.SoleNationHealth.com and www.Litefoot.com. Pre-orders for the shoe are $99, with the regular price set at $124.99. The shoe will also be available at a wholesale price for tribal clinics to purchase for their respective diabetes programs. --- Though the shoe is designed for everybody, its target market is younger people with diabetes.The shoe idea came about earlier this year when Litefoot met Ernesto Castro, a citizen of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona, who started the Native American-owned company, Sole Nation Health. The company’s mission is to provide footwear for the prevention of diabetic-related foot problems and to offer therapeutic shoe-fitting education to individuals in Native communities. It was after meeting Castro at a reservation economic summit in April that Litefoot and Castro came up with the idea of producing a stylish shoe for diabetics. “I approached him and gave him one of our flyers and we just started talking,” Castro said. “I just talked to him and I said ‘you know what? There are a lot of kids now who have diabetes and a lot kids who have neuropathy.’ We were finding that teenagers, 20-year-olds and 30-year-olds were getting amputations. I want to design a sneaker for them and it would be great if we collaborated and do something together.’”Without hesitation, Litefoot said he began looking for a shoe design idea based on what he liked. He took what he believed to be inspirational Native elements that he thought would work well on the sneaker and came up with the design. Litefoot Aboriginal Footwear started production soon after. The sneaker, which is mostly hand-made, are made out of leather and displays an arrow on the back of the shoe as well as on the sides. The shoes will be available in beige, or earth, black and white. --- “The reason I put the arrows on the shoe is because I felt that this shoe should serve as inspiration; it should serve as momentum and forward progress,” Litefoot said. “The reason the arrow is pointing up on the back of the shoe is because I want people to really get that upward feel and inspirational feeling. The whole thought of rising and elevating and never thinking that there are boundaries for Native people. I really wanted that to be the inspiration behind the shoe.” The sneaker, which will be released Oct. 11, are available for purchase online at www.SoleNationHealth.com and www.Litefoot.com. Pre-orders for the shoe are $99, with the regular price set at $124.99. The shoe will also be available at a wholesale price for tribal clinics to purchase for their respective diabetes programs. Castro said his company has received more than 50 individual and more than 300 tribal nation pre-orders. Both companies have agreed to give a percentage of the profit to Native youth organizations and people throughout Indian Country. “I like to think that I’ve always been successful in those things that I put my mind to in Indian Country,” Litefoot said. “I’ve definitely put my mind to this, and it’s going to be not only something that’s cool and hot for people to wear in Indian Country and be proud of, but it’s going to serve our diabetic patients.”

Fort Smith tour changes Cherokee Nation employees’ perceptions
05/10/2010 07:07 AM
FORT SMITH, Ark. – Cherokee Nation employees filled a charter bus on April 30 in Tahlequah, Okla., and traveled to the Fort Smith National Historic Site to learn more about the site’s ties to Cherokee history.Fort Smith is mostly known for Judge Isaac Parker, who presided over the federal court there from 1875-96 and received a reputation of being a “hanging judge.”“I actually do defend Judge Parker. He gets a horrible reputation as being a hanging judge, but it was the law and he had no other choice but to carry it out,” said Ashley Richards, a Fort Smith National Historic Site Park Ranger, to CN employees at the fort’s gallows. “A lot of people don’t realize ‘the hanging judge’ was against the death penalty.”Richards said Parker advocated for alternatives to capital punishment, was a supporter of Native American rights and impartial when it came to justice. Contrary to some beliefs, she said records show Parker was even-handed in his sentences and did not sentence an inordinate number of Native people to death. While on the bench, Parker tried 13,490 cases, 344 of which were capital crimes. Of the 156 men and four women sentenced to death by Parker, 79 were actually hanged. The rest died in jail, appealed or were pardoned. Several famous lawmen also served as deputy marshals for the Parker court, including Cherokees Zeke Proctor and Sam Sixkiller. About 110 deputy marshals were killed in the line of duty during Parker’s time on the bench, including Sixkiller.Cynthia Cavin, a CN Asset Management clerk, said she enjoyed the tour because it allowed her to connect Fort Smith’s history with Cherokee history. “It filled in some blanks for me,” she said. “One interesting thing was learning more about Judge Parker and how he has been misrepresented. He really just enforced the death penalty, and I didn’t know he never saw a hanging himself.” Lydia Harjo McBroom, a parenting para-professional for Indian Child Welfare, said she thought the tour was “great” yet sad at times because she thought about her ancestors who traveled through Fort Smith. “It’s exciting to see where our ancestors were, but also it’s sad. It probably wasn’t exciting for them or enjoyable,” said McBroom, who is Muscogee Creek and Choctaw. During the removals of the 1830s, most of the Five Civilized Tribes stopped in Fort Smith for supplies before crossing the Arkansas River into Indian Territory. Catherine Foreman Gray, an interpretive supervisor for CN Cultural Tourism, said Cherokee history and Fort Smith history are “completely intertwined.” The fort was established to protect Old Settler Cherokees who moved to eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas voluntarily in the early 1800s from the Osage tribe that claimed much of eastern Oklahoma. “Fort Smith was established to try maintain peace in the area,” said Gray, who previously worked as a Fort Smith National Historic Site Park Ranger. The fort was abandoned in 1824, and Fort Gibson was established further up the Arkansas River, west of Tahlequah, to protect Cherokees from the Osage. Gray said a federal court continued to operate in Fort Smith and had jurisdiction over all of Indian Territory, including the CN.Gray also said Cherokee patriots Zeke Proctor and Ned Christie, who are profiled in the Fort Smith National Historic Site, fascinate her. Considered outlaws by some, she said both men, in their own way, challenged the court’s jurisdiction over Cherokee legal matters and believed only the CN had authority to hear their cases. “It’s a great example of the jurisdictional issues and the conflict that was going on between Indian Territory and this federal court,” she said. “Ned Christie is a great example of someone who really stood up against this court and really stood up against the federal government.”She said Proctor and Christie tried to force the federal government to keep its promise of letting the CN be a sovereign nation if it moved west. “Ned Christie is probably one of favorite characters in all of Cherokee history,” Gray said. “I really admire what he stood up for.” She added that her interest in outlaw history led her to research Fort Smith booking records when she worked there. She said eventually she found family names.“It is interesting how many of our ancestors, rightfully or wrongfully, for whatever reason they were here, some were just witnesses, how many names you run across,” she said. “It’s fascinating history.”

Cherokee Rangers crew chief wants more employees
05/05/2010 07:05 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – With dry and windy conditions come greater risks of wildfires, and it’s up to the Cherokee Rangers to protect Cherokee Nation lands from those wildfire risks. --- However, Cherokee Rangers crew coordinator David Comingdeer said it’s hard to keep a steady crew when he is the only Ranger employed full time. The nine other Rangers are seasonal employees paid by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. --- Comingdeer said his crew, which operates out of the tribe’s Natural Resources Department, deserves to be hired full time by the tribe because of its knowledge about wildfires and its dedication to protecting CN lands. --- The first Rangers crew formed on Feb. 8, 2008, when eight Cherokee men graduated from the Wildland Fire Basic Training in Ada, Okla. Since that time, the team has suppressed more than 1,000 wildfires, with 407 located within the tribe’s jurisdiction. --- “Seventy-five percent of those (fires) were on Cherokee tribal lands, with the remaining 25 percent being a direct threat to tribal lands,” Comingdeer said of the jurisdictional fires. --- He said in 2009 the Rangers helped suppress more than 50 wildfires in other tribal jurisdictions in Oklahoma, as well as nine other states. --- He added that he would like to see the tribe hire the other Rangers because he runs the risk of losing them to full-time jobs elsewhere, which would result in having to train a new crew. --- “It’s very difficult because when you train men like this through federal classes and get them federally qualified as a wild land firefighter, it’s not something you want to go through ever year with a big turnover rate because the guys lose interest,” he said. --- Comingdeer said in 2009 the seasonal Rangers found it hard to make a living with the cool, wet fire season. He said, “to make ends meet, the Rangers worked the last several months off and on” through the tribe’s Day Work Program spending much of the time working at the Cherokee Heritage Center. --- However, that program closed on April 1 due to a lack of funding. Tribal officials have said that it may return, but not until late May or early June. --- “Our job, we’re busy throughout the winter and spring, but this year it’s been a slow season. We were on the Day Work Program probably about two or three days out of the week, and you know it’s a pay cut,” said Ranger Isaac Merchant. “We have to do what we got to, to feed our families. We’re all proud citizens of the Cherokee Nation, and we’ll do our job no matter what we have to do.” --- Comingdeer said he also wants to see the Rangers hired because they work extended hours, don’t pay into Social Security or receive benefits. On fire danger days, the Rangers are on call and are paid in case a fire erupts. But on days when they aren’t, they are considered unemployed. --- “…If they’re sick they have to work or they don’t get paid. If the weather doesn’t permit us to have wildfire, then they don’t work. They don’t get paid,” he said. --- Comingdeer also said crew members many times have had to wait eight to 10 weeks to receive a check from the BIA, and even then many times it’s two and three checks at once. --- “…the rest of us we get a paycheck every two weeks no matter if we show up or not cause we can turn in leave and things like that,” he said. “…these men are all anxious to have gainful employment here through the Cherokee Nation and enjoy the same benefits that everyone else has because these guys are here for the long haul and they have stuck it out two years.” --- Natural Resources Director Pat Gwin said the difficulty with hiring more Rangers is that there isn’t enough money to do so. --- “At the present time, unfortunately, the funds do not even cover the salary of one person. Those funds come down from a federal agency, and we don’t really have input on that. It’s based on funding availability,” Gwin said. “We are responsible for maintaining a preparedness/pre-suppression program to the level that they (BIA) fund it.” --- He said in the future, Natural Resources officials hope to change the program from pre-suppression to a prevention program that will potentially offer more funding.

Camp Cherokee applications available
04/16/2010 07:00 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – The dates for Camp Cherokee 2010 have been set for July 18-23, and applications are available online or for pickup at the Cherokee Nation. --- Camp Cherokee is a free Arts Institute and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) Academy combined into one camp. --- According to the application, the camp is operated by CN Education Services and is an enriching cultural and academic experience for CN students. --- This year, 175 middle and high school students, entering sixth through 12th grades, will be selected. In 2009, the camp accepted 297 students. However, the large number also made for large class sizes, sometimes with more than 35 students in a class, said CN Director of Fine Arts Bill Andoe. --- “This provides us the opportunity to have smaller class sizes, which teachers will welcome,” he said. “Certain classes we wanted to tailor differently. We definitely want students to apply early because certain classes are going to fill very quickly.” ---  MORE INFORMATION ---  Visit the Web site ---  or e-mail camp@cherokee.org --- The camp’s location has also changed. In 2009, the camp was held at the Salvation Army Camp Heart O’ the Hills in Welling, Okla., but this year the camp will be held at Sequoyah Schools in Tahlequah. ---  “It was a lot of fun out there (in Welling) but it was also expensive,” Andoe said. “This was just part of a whole cost-conscious decision to change locations this year. But where one door closes another one opens.” ---  Having Camp Cherokee at Sequoyah Schools allows instructors and students to have more opportunities to do experiments and take field trips, he said. ---  “We do have more opportunities with the lab space and being more centrally located and next door to the complex will help us take advantage of the opportunities at the complex,” Andoe said. “And maybe next year we’ll move some place else. We just don’t know yet.” ---  Daniel Faddis, CN Education Outreach specialist, said Sequoyah should also provide more opportunities for the camp’s science aspect. ---  “I think Sequoyah is going to bring some bright opportunities for my science classes this year,” he said. “We’re having an actual science lab to have to be able to do some actual laboratory chemistry activities.” ---  The camp will utilize the school’s dormitories and will therefore still be a residential camp. ---  “We really try to emphasize that because it’s all encompassing,” Andoe said. ---  The camp includes a daily morning meeting for campers, spending time together in class, recreation time in the afternoon and big evening events. ---  Classes available are acting, basketry, dance, digital arts, drawing and painting, photography, pottery, singing, sketching nature, traditional Cherokee crafts, video, singing voice lessons, laboratory chemistry, engineering activities, Native Approach to Science, competitive robotics and Native Science of the River Valley. ---  Students can download the application at www.camp.cherokee.org. Applications can be mailed to CN Education Services Administration or dropped off at the W.W. Keeler Tribal Complex.

03/08/2010 07:27 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Despite tighter budgets, the J.D. McCarty Center in Norman is moving forward with plans to build Camp ClapHans in honor of the late Sammy Jack Claphan, a Cherokee Nation citizen. --- Camp ClapHans will be the first summer camp of its kind in Oklahoma, McCarty Center officials said. It will have the usual summer camp activities such as swimming and horseback riding, but it will be unique in that the camp will be accessible to children 8 to 16 years old with disabilities and/or in wheelchairs. --- Uwe von Schamann, J.D. McCarty director of Development and former University of Oklahoma Sooners kicker, said the organization has funding to build two cabins at the Norman-based camp this year. The Cherokee Nation is financing and building one cabin in honor of Claphan, who was von Schamann’s teammate at OU, while the Chickasaw Nation is financing the other cabin. --- “I’d say within six months we are going to break ground (for the cabins), but it’s definitely going to happen this year. Hopefully, next year we’ll start having one-week camps. So that’s kind of where we are,” von Schamann said. --- He said he is working other Oklahoma tribes to raise funds for two more cabins and a mess hall to be named after Claphan. In the meantime, he said, the camp would use its multi-purpose building for a temporary mess hall. --- State and national economy woes have slowed fundraising for more cabins, the mess hall and a swimming pool. State budget cuts took away some of the surplus money the J.D. McCarty Center once had, von Schamann said. --- Construction costs have also risen since October 2008 when ground was broken for the project. The camp’s initial total cost of $4.5 million has doubled, he said. --- “We can’t build the whole camp right now, but we can at least get started,” he said. --- The McCarty Center is also focused on raising money for scholarships to help disabled children attend summer camps. A bowling event is set for May 6 to raise scholarship endowment funding. Four-person teams can participate in the seventh annual “Gutter Dance” fundraiser by paying $200 per team or $50 per person. The cost includes a meal and two games. People can also sponsor a bowling lane for $100, and corporate sponsorships are $500. --- Claphan died in 2001 at the age of 45. He grew up near Stilwell in Adair County and received a scholarship to play football for the Sooners in 1974. --- He was an All-American offensive guard at OU and helped the Sooners win two national championships in 1974 and 1975. The Cleveland Browns drafted him in 1979. He was later traded to the San Diego Chargers where he played offensive tackle until 1987. --- After his retirement, he returned to Oklahoma where he coached football at Midwest City Carl Albert High School and Stilwell. He retired from coaching in 1999, devoting his time to being a special education teacher at Stilwell. --- Initially, only a cabin was going to be named after Claphan, von Schamann said, but the sound of his friend’s last name lent a hand in eventually naming the camp after him. --- Along with being teammates at OU, von Schamann said he and Claphan were competitors in the NFL because von Schamann kicked for the Miami Dolphins while Claphan played for the Chargers. --- “We were just really good friends, and during the off season we would spend time together. We were very close,” he said. --- The J.D. McCarty Center was founded in 1946 to treat cerebral palsy. Since that time, the hospital has expanded by treating more than 70 different diagnoses of developmental disabilities.

Video: Cherokee Nation Amo Health Center breaks ground for dental clinic
03/01/2010 06:58 AM
SALINA, Okla. – Cherokee Nation Health Services officials on Feb. 23 broke ground at the Amo Health Center on the tribe’s sixth dental clinic, something that has been in the works for nearly a decade. --- “This will tremendously help our patients in this area,” Melissa Gower, Health Services group leader, said. “Once opened, the facility will be adding new staff and equipment to ensure the best overall care for our citizens and our patients from other tribes. We have looked forward to this day for a long time.” --- The clinic is expected to have eight dental chairs and state-of-the-art equipment, costing more than $500,000, to allow citizens a more enjoyable time while utilizing the clinic. Clinic plans also include electronic dental records, digital radiology for X-rays and monitors for patients. --- Officials said tribal citizens in the area travel great distances to receive dental care since the only CN dental clinics are located in Tahlequah, Muskogee, Jay, Sallisaw and Stilwell. However, in less than a year, tribal officials said that should not be the case because they hope the Salina dental clinic to be functional. Another dental clinic is planned for Vinita. --- The groundbreaking in Salina was music to some local residents’ ears. --- “I never thought I would see this day come,” said CN citizen Lavonne Littledave. “It is great that we are going to have a dentist here. I’m very excited.” --- Gower said the addition would not only make dental care more accessible for citizens, but the clinic would also stimulate more jobs for the area, including dentists, a dental hygienist, two desk attendees and dental assistants. --- The Amo Health Center currently provides outpatient medical services, pediatrics, public health nursing, laboratory, pharmacy, community nutrition, radiology, optometry, behavioral health, WIC and contract care. In 2009, the health center provided more than 45,000 patient visits to individuals needing health care. --- The center is located on 10 acres of land where it is said CN citizens and other area residents traded for salt. This is why the facility is referred to as Amo, which translated in Cherokee to “the salt place.” --- Gower said Dist. 6 Tribal Councilors Meredith Frailey and Chris Soap have worked diligently with the health group on making this idea reality. --- “(Meredith) and Chris worked very hard with us to insure that we are able to fulfill this day for the community members that live here in Mayes County,” she said. “We’re excited to do that so you don’t have to drive to Jay or Tahlequah or some other place to get your dental services.” --- Principal Chief Chad Smith said it was a great day for the CN, its citizens and other Native Americans living in the area. --- “We are dedicated to working with our communities, families and individuals to promote and improve their health. This clinic will help us achieve that goal,” he said. “This will result in healthy communities for this and future generations.”

Cherokee Nation buries time capsule at complex
01/28/2010 07:20 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cherokee Nation workers lowered into the ground a time capsule on Jan. 25 in front of the W.W. Keeler Tribal Complex. The capsule is to be opened in 18 years. --- “The value of a time capsule is that it provides a reflection of the past. What is unique about this one is that it is a benchmark for future generations,” Principal Chief Chad Smith said. “People in 2028 will open this and have to answer the question ‘Did we pass along our great Cherokee legacy?” --- Officials chose the year 2028 to open the after reviewing a video the tribe produced in 2003 that asks what the CN would look like 25 years. --- Smith said after seeing the steps CN has taken to develop the tribe and its people, the real challenge would be to see where the tribe is in the next 18 years. --- “There are a number of us in this room that will not be here when this capsule opens, but a number of us will be,” he said. “The leaders of today are our children…they will be here 18 years from now opening up this capsule and you (the children) will have the unique perspective of what it was like 18 years ago.” --- The capsule was filled with a print and video copy of the 2009 Annual Report to the Cherokee People, a copy of the Cherokee Phoenix, an I-pod Nano containing songs by the Cherokee National Youth Choir, information about CN programs and cultural tourism, a variety of seed corn, the CN flag, photos of current officials from the three branches of government, the tribe’s constitution, a photo of Principal Chief Chad Smith with President Barack Obama and a photo of those to witness the capsule event. --- Drawings and letters written in Cherokee from the tribe’s Cherokee language immersion school from pre-kindergarten through fourth grade were also included. --- Brian Jackson, a community partnership specialist for the tribe’s Leadership Group, was the individual who proposed the idea of the time capsule. --- “One day I was walking in front of the complex where they were redoing the sidewalk thinking ‘I wonder what it was like when they poured that? What CN was like? What the area was like? How interesting it would be if we could actually see some of those things now,” he said. --- Jackson said since workers were refurbishing the sidewalk, he thought it was a perfect time to put in a time capsule. --- “I have been here since 1995, and I have seen a lot of changes, so if we did a time capsule now how interesting would it be for our youth to see how far we have come along,” he said.

TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Young science, mathematics and engineering-oriented students will be exhibiting months of research, experiments and conclusions on Jan. 23 at the fourth annual Cherokee Nation Science and Engineering Fair. --- The deadline for the science and engineering fair has been extended to Jan. 15, which is just a little more than a week before the event. --- The fair is still separated into two divisions, which are grades 5–8 and 9-12. The fair will take place at Northeastern State University’s Herb Rozzell Ballroom. --- “It’s open to anybody in those ages who is Cherokee,” said Daniel Faddis, CN Education Outreach specialist. --- The fair is an opportunity for Cherokee students to participate in a science-based learning environment and create science projects that can be shared with peers, educators and professionals, according to a cover letter sent to schools. --- The fair also provides a forum for students to have their research recognized and critiqued in the disciplines of science, mathematics, engineering, technology and cultural preservation. --- Student will also have the opportunity to win prizes and awards at the fair. --- In December Faddis served as a judge at the Catoosa High School Science Fair, he also visited Grove High School where he was able walk through their lab and get a sneak preview of their projects. --- “I admired how organized they were,” Faddis said. “It’s exciting.” --- Some students didn’t have the lab equipment available to complete their projects, but they didn’t quit working on them. The students simply built the tools and equipment they needed to complete their projects, he said. --- “For them to take that leadership and ambition and achieve a project shows outstanding caliber,” Faddis said. “It’s amazing to me that these students gave up social time to care enough about research and their project.” --- At the Jan. 23 fair, judges will evaluate and focus on what the student did in the current year; how well a student followed the scientific, engineering, computer programming or mathematical methodologies; the detail and accuracy of research as documented in the data book; and whether experimental procedures were used in the best possible way. --- Categories at the CNSEF include animal sciences, chemistry, computer science, biochemistry, environmental management, engineering, microbiology and medicine and health sciences among many other categories. --- For more information, call Faddis at (918) 453-5224 or e-mail daniel-faddis@cherokee.org.

Cherokee Nation acquires 9 properties in 2009
12/10/2009 01:47 PM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – According to Cherokee Nation Management Resources, in 2009 the tribe purchased eight properties and received one as a donation, all of which are located within the CN jurisdiction. --- In Rogers County, the Rogers County Cherokee Association in Tiawah donated 8.84 acres to the tribe so that it could be placed into trust. The association’s building residing on the property will continue to be used by community members. --- The donation was finalized on Feb. 15, but the property has yet to receive its trust status. --- “It is one of our strategic initiatives to work with communities in ways that will help them become stronger and self sufficient. Therefore it would not be considered uncommon for a group to donate land to the tribe so we can place the land in trust, which obviously results in Cherokee Nation not having to pay taxes,” Angela Drewes, Management Resources interim group leader, said. “We have many lease agreements and land assignments on trust property that affords tribal citizens and community organizations the use of tribal trust property.” --- The tribe also bought two properties in Adair County in 2009. On Feb. 23, Cherokee Nation Entertainment purchased 2.13 acres for $1,500 in the Salem community to be used for landfill access. --- Another 190 acres were purchased on March 24 in the Fairfield community for $251,750. The tribe bought the property for affordable housing activities. --- “Currently, it is planned for self -help SIP (structured insulated panel) panel homes,” Drewes said. “It was planned to accommodate 26 units.” --- In Sequoyah County, the tribe purchased 330 acres on April 24 next to the Redbird Ceremonial Grounds for $250,000 with the expectation of using the land for 30 self-help housing units, Drewes said. --- In Tulsa County, the tribe purchased 44 acres on July 8 near Collinsville for $130,000. The property, formerly owned by Acme Brick, was purchased for utility easement and access to a Cherokee organization’s existing community building on the connecting property. --- Drewes said the Victory Cherokee Community Organization is developing plans for the tract’s future use and that it’s common for CN to purchase property to help a community association get the needed utilities to its community building, especially when a neighbor refuses to grant a utility easement. --- “…the tribe bought raw land that was owned by ACME Brick Co., to afford the Victory Cherokee Community Organization the ability to get electric run to their community building. And yes, this group will be allowed to enter into a lease agreement for management of the property,” Drewes said. “The Cherokee Nation Natural Resources department is working with the organization regarding land use/development strategies.” --- The tribe also purchased four properties in Cherokee County in 2009. A little more than a half acre (0.56) was purchased for $2,000 on July 27 for access to Ross Cemetery in Park Hill. --- The property is being developed by the tribe’s Cultural Tourism department and is expected to be a stop for people interested in the tribe’s history, Drewes said. --- On July 29, two more properties in Cherokee County totaling 396 acres were purchased along the Bertha Parka Bypass for possible business development and affordable housing activities. --- As of press time no definite plans for commercial development had been decided, and the tribe is in the planning stages of using part of the property for 57 housing units, Drewes said. --- The cost for the two properties combined was $1.2 million. --- On Aug. 14, two-tenths of an acre was purchased in Tahlequah on the corner of Downing and Water streets for possible business development. The property cost $42,500.

Annual screenings can prevent cervical cancer
12/09/2009 07:26 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer afflicting women, but if caught early is curable. That is the message that will be echoed during January, which is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month. --- “Cervical cancer, if detected early, is almost 100 percent curable,” said Barbara Neal, CN Cancer Programs health educator. “It is one of the most preventable cancers. That’s simply by having the pap (smear) test.” --- Cervical cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the cervix. It is usually a slow-growing cancer that may not have symptoms but can be found with regular pap tests, according to the Web site www.cancer.gov. --- The Pap smear test is a procedure in which cells are scraped from the cervix and looked at under a microscope, according to the site. The Pap smear test helps to identify abnormal cell changes and infection or conditions requiring treatment. ---  MORE INFORMATION ---  For more information about CN Cancer Programs, call Barbara Neal at (918) 453-5138, or e-mail barbara-neal@cherokee.org. --- “You can’t see or feel early signs of cervical cancer, unlike other cancers. It’s one of those silent things that’s there,” Neal said. --- Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer found in women, behind breast cancer, according to the Web site. --- All of the CN clinics, CN W.W. Hastings Indian Hospital in Tahlequah and the Claremore Indian Hospital offer the human papilloma virus vaccine, also known as Gardasil. --- The vaccine is used as an immunization, Neal said. It is given to females beginning at age 9 through 18. --- “The HPV vaccine helps prevent four types of cervical cancer, as well as genital warts and some of the HPV viruses,” Neal said. --- “The real thing that we’re hoping for and that we would like to try to inform the Cherokee Nation is women getting pap smears because pap smears are the real things that are going to help stop cervical cancer,” Neal said. “That’s the only thing that’s going to get us to that point. That’s the only test we have right now to test for cervical cancer.” --- Women don’t like to have pap smears but they are needed, she said. She said the important thing to remember is that cervical cancer can affect women at any age.

Paiten Taylor heading to University of Central Oklahoma
11/19/2009 07:10 AM
HULBERT, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen and Hulbert High School senior Paiten Taylor signed her national letter of intent with the University of Central Oklahoma on Nov. 11, securing herself a college education. --- “The coach saw me play in a tournament in Dallas and then the very next weekend he came down and talked to me,” Taylor said. --- She said UCO, an NCAA Division II school, was the right place for her after visiting its Edmond campus. --- “Their coach was really positive and just seemed like a really fun time there. Their players are all ready to play and seem like they really wanted to be there. And it’s a really really nice town.” --- Taylor could have gone the NCAA Division I route. But one of UCO’s selling points was its proximity to her home. --- “I was interested in Boise State (in Idaho) and they were interested in me, but that was really far away. Wyoming and Hendrix College (in Conway, Ark.) were the only other ones I was looking at,” she said. --- Like many student athletes, Taylor found the recruiting process stressful and tiring. --- “They used to call whenever they were allowed to and talk to me for 30 minutes to an hour. Even if I told them I had to go they wouldn’t listen and still talk. It got kind of annoying at times,” she said. --- Taylor’s mother, Jackie Murphy, also played basketball in college and tried to help Taylor as much as she could. --- “My process was totally different. I just told her she had to be comfortable with the decision she made, and it was her decision. Whatever she decided we told her we would be there to support her,” Murphy said. --- That support may be needed making that adjustment from high school to college basketball. --- “I think the hardest part will be playing with four other girls who can score and four other girls who are just ready to be there and ready to play all the time,” Taylor said. --- Alicia Zodrow, Hulbert’s first-year girls hoops coach, said Taylor should fit in just fine at UCO because of her ability to read the floor and to take control and know what’s going on. --- “She is just a great player and has an athletic ability that is hard for the other team to defend,” Zodrow said. --- At the time of her signing, Taylor said she didn’t know what she would major in at UCO. However, she said no matter what it is, her goal is to have a high grade point average and excel in the classroom just like she does on the court. --- “Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do it. Don’t let anyone else make your choices for you. They are yours to make,” she said.

San Diego Cherokee Nation citizen also TV personality
11/06/2009 07:05 AM
SAN DIEGO, Calif. – As San Diego Cherokee Community Councilor Phil Konstantin addressed fellow SDCC members during a picnic in October it was obvious he was comfortable with a microphone. --- That comfort stems from working at KUSI, a local independent television station. Konstantin recently became the evening assignment editor after being the station’s traffic reporter for more than four years. --- “What I liked was that I got to work with a really nice bunch of people. We were in the early morning news so we could be a little more light hearted and didn’t have to be quite so serious,” he said. “I got to meet a lot of interesting people. We got a lot of TV personalities, movie stars, government officials and lot interesting local folks, and I had a chance to sit down and talk and interact with those people.” --- Before landing his KUSI job, Konstantin served with the California Highway Patrol giving traffic reports for the ABC affiliate KGTV for nearly nine years. --- Prior to moving to southern California, he lived in Houston for 27 years. There he worked at NASA from 1972-75 and assisted with the last two Apollo moon flights, Apollo 16 and 17. --- Konstantin said he met and fell in love with a girl from Houston whose family moved to California. He followed her there after her father helped him get a job in construction. After two years, he said he wanted a more stable job and joined the CHP in 1985. His first patrol assignment was in Los Angeles, but he eventually transferred to San Diego to be closer to his children. --- “I spent three and a half years here in San Diego patrolling the roads, and then I spent another 15 years being the public affairs officer for this division of the highway patrol, so I was on TV a lot,” he said. --- He retired from the CHP in 2005 and began working with KUSI four days later. --- While in San Diego he became active with the SDCC, despite the fact that it took his family 40 years to obtain Cherokee Nation citizenship cards because his maternal Cherokee grandfather left the family when his mother was 7 years old and was not heard from again. --- “We had a hard time proving that the person on the rolls was my grandfather. So, it almost became a matter of pride to prove somewhere on paper that I was Cherokee,” he said. “I’m mostly European American, but I grew up with a great and deep respect for being a Cherokee. My mother was very proud of that particular part.” --- He said he has spent much time learning about Cherokee culture and history and was eager to join the SDCC to learn more. --- “This chance to participate in this organization has really made me more aware and educated of what it is to be a Cherokee in this community and this day and age,” he said. --- His study of Native American culture and history led him to write the book “This Day in North American Indian History.” He also wrote six of the 24 chapters for “Native America History for Dummies,” and contributed an article and appendix items for “Treaties with American Indians.” His latest book is titled “The Wacky World of Laws” and details “crazy laws around the country,” Konstantin said.

SALINA, Okla. – The American Indian Resource Center in Tahlequah spent October presenting cyber safety information to 15 area schools as part of Cyber Safety Awareness Month. --- On Oct. 28, AIRC Talent Search Director Audra Conner presented information dealing with identity protection while on the Internet to Salina High School students. --- “We just get out information to junior high and high school students so that when they go online they use safe and ethical behaviors and (taking) measures that keep their computer safe as well as themselves,” Conner said. She added that during her presentations she saw on students’ faces that her message was hitting home. “You see it on their faces. They’re like, ‘I do that’ or ‘I’ve done that.’ You can tell that you’re hitting on some areas that their familiar with, but when you relate some stories about things that have actually happened because of that kind of behavior then you know it really gets their attention.” --- Conner used an example of a 16-year-old student who was charged as a sex offender for taking sexually graphic pictures of his girlfriend and then sending them to his friends via phone texts after the couple separated. --- “When we talk about the parts where you can actually become labeled as a sex offender by e-mailing pictures and sexting (texts dealing with sexual content), you know that’s a little more than awareness because they didn’t think you can get charged for anything like that,” she said. --- Conner also said she learned some dos and don’ts when it comes to the Internet and personal information. --- “I didn’t understand that any computer has an IP address and it can be accessed by anyone, anywhere at anytime,” she said. “I think probably one of the things that opened my eyes was that I put my kids’ pictures (on the computer). I have a Facebook account and I put their pictures with their sports uniforms on, and I had to take those off because that’s one of the things you should not be doing.” --- She said the reasoning for putting personal is because some jerseys have the kids’ and town names on them. “All someone would have to do is Google that name and that particular town and they know where you and your children are,” Conner said. “It’s kind of scary.” --- She said any parent, school or business using the Internet and computers would benefit from this information and that the information would be available on AIRC’s talent search Web site www.aircinc.org. --- “I think any parent who has a computer in their home or kids who have phones with Internet access…needs to have this information and be involved,” Conner said. “You may have this information, but if you don’t know what your kids is doing online and you don’t take the time to check or look then you’re just as guilty as they are by letting them have bad behavior online.” --- The AIRC was able to present the cyber safety information to junior high and high school students thanks to a grant, Connor said. --- The AIRC is a non-profit agency that develops culturally appropriate resources and provides expertise to and on behalf of tribes, organizations and schools nation wide.

Cherokee citizen grows symbolic seed corn
10/07/2009 07:12 AM
By Adam Johnson --- Phoenix Intern --- BARNSDALL, Okla. – Cherokee Nation citizen Andy Vann has been an educator in Barnsdall for 34 years. He coached football, taught math and has always been an important member of this Osage County community. --- At the 2008 Cherokee National Holiday, Principal Chief Chad Smith challenged tribal citizens to prepare for the future with respect, tradition and appreciation as well as education and learning. Symbolizing that challenge, tribal officials gave out packets of seed corn to holiday guests. Vann, among others, received such a packet. --- Earlier this spring, Vann planted those seeds, and he said all but one stock grew upright. --- “It was my idea (to plant the seeds), but it was the leadership of Chief Chad Smith, who when he gave us the seeds, challenged me to do so. I brought home the packet of seeds from the 2008 Cherokee Holiday celebration, and said, ‘I’m going to plant these seeds next spring,’” he said. --- Four of the corn stalks eventually grew and sprouted corn, while one received damage during a windstorm. --- “When the stalks were much higher than my head, a storm came up one night and blew one of the stalks over,” he said. --- Vann said he braced the other stocks with broom handles to ensure their survival over the stormy summer. His plan succeeded and the corn stocks survived. As of Oct. 1, the remaining stocks were about 8-feet tall and healthy, he said. --- Vann said his tall corn plants shocked his neighbors. “It surprised them to see them up above my head.” --- Vann said he learned about corn from his grandfather, and being a longtime educator, he likened his experience growing the corn to teaching. --- “When we teach, we address our students in much the same manner that we do when we plant a garden,” he said. “We carefully prepare, plant the seeds, cultivate, water and tend with care and watch while they grow taller than we are.” --- He said harvesting the corn is similar to children who take what they have learned and make the world a better place.

Video:Tribe artificially increases wishi population
10/06/2009 07:08 AM
KANSAS, Okla. – In a wooded area on Cherokee Nation trust land, two men from the tribe’s Natural Resources department give Mother Nature some help with growing wishi (or wissy) mushrooms. --- The maitake mushroom, also known as grifola frondosa, is considered a delicacy by many Cherokee people who find them growing near the base of hardwood trees. Also known as the “Hen of the Woods,” the large mushrooms have brown caps and white undersides and usually grow in clusters at the base of red oak trees in northeastern Oklahoma. --- Natural Resources Acting Director Pat Gwin and Natural Resources specialist Mark Dunham spent time in September drilling small holes at the base of trees, where roots connect, and placing plugs containing grifola frondosa in the hole before sealing them with wax. --- Gwin said wishi is a fungus that grows in the roots of trees. In northeastern Oklahoma, it mainly grows in red oak trees. As an experiment, Gwin and Dunham placed capsules in various trees, including chinquapin oak, green ash, post oak, hickory, white hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, elm and ash. --- “Because it’s so difficult to find these things (mushrooms), we basically wanted to see if we could artificially increase the population,” Gwin said. --- The tribe bought 300 plugs containing grifola frondosa from a company in the state of Washington. The plugs needed to be placed in the trees during a period of high moisture that’s not followed by hot weather and a month before the first frost, Gwin said, which usually occurs in northeastern Oklahoma in early to mid-November. The conditions in September were ideal because the area received heavy rainfall. --- Six different sites in Adair, Cherokee and Delaware counties were chosen for the wishi mushroom experiment because those counties have a large population of mature red oak trees. --- Gwin said he expects the capsules to produce wishi in two to three years and that he used a global positioning system or GPS to mark each location where the capsules were left. He said he and his staff plan to visit the locations to check on the plugs’ progress. --- “The fungus will become mature. It will send out its reproductive part, the great big wishi, and then it can be harvested. The actual wishi that people pick, that’s just the flower of the plan,” he said. “It’s really the third year when we’re looking to find something.” --- He said wishi mushrooms clusters can grow large enough to fill a four-gallon washtub. The proper way to pick it is to cut it off its base and not pull it off. --- To prepare it for eating, he said, it should be boiled two or three times to remove the bugs and dirt. After that it is cut up, salted and floured and deep-fried. --- “Several years ago a number of elders had wishi trees, and with wishi trees the locations are kept secret and passed down to their family. I was lucky to have a few trees passed down to me. A lot of those trees have died,” he said. “Several years of drought have wreaked havoc on the wishi population. What we’re really trying is get those numbers back up.” ---  Reach Staff Writer Will Chavez at (918) 207-3961 or will-chavez@cherokee.org

Diabetes awareness important for Native Americans
10/02/2009 07:07 AM
TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – November is National Diabetes Awareness Month, a perfect time for Native Americans to become aware of the disease since it strikes them hard. --- According to the American Diabetes Association, 12.2 percent of the Native Americans over the age of 19 living in the U.S. has type 2 diabetes. That type is generally found in adults and treated with insulin. However, more and more Native youths are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. --- Cherokee Nation citizen Josh Eller was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2001 on his 19th birthday. He said it showed up “out of the blue” and completely rearranged his life. --- “I had to pretty much re-teach myself how to eat and drink because I couldn’t eat or drink the stuff I was used to…that was probably the most difficult (to adjust to),” he said. --- Eller said after being diagnosed he gained weight because his body wasn’t producing the insulin it needed to push sugar into his muscles. --- “When I started taking insulin it (pancreas) started working right again,” he said. --- According to Diabetes World, the pancreas produces enzymes that aid in the digestive process and converts sugar to energy. It secretes enzyme and hormones, including insulin, that are needed for the digestion and absorption of food. --- Diabetes occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce or secrete sufficient quantities of insulin. --- He noticed a problem when he exercised one day and felt completely ran down the next. He had difficulty waking and frequent urination, two symptoms of diabetes. This went on for two months, he said, before going to a doctor and discovering the cause. --- According to the ADA, type 1 and type 2 diabetes have different causes. First, one must inherit a predisposition to the disease and second, something in the environment must trigger diabetes. --- In most cases of type 1 diabetes, one needs to inherit risk factors from both parents. Type 1 diabetes is less common in people who were breastfed and in those who first ate solid foods at later ages. In many people, the development of type 1 diabetes seems to take many years. --- Type 2 diabetes has a stronger genetic basis than type 1, yet it also depends more on environmental factors. It is common in people who have too much fatty food in their diet. Obesity is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes and is the most risky for young people and those who have been obese for a long time. --- According to the ADA, women who get diabetes while they are pregnant are more likely to have a family history of diabetes, especially on their mothers’ side. But as in other forms of diabetes, non-genetic factors play a role. Older mothers and overweight women are more likely to get gestational diabetes. --- Eller said there were many people in his family with diabetes, but their cases were type 2 whereas his was considered to be juvenile diabetes or type 1. --- He said he treats his diabetes with an insulin pump, not shots. But many people require taking insulin shots. In other cases, people may have to take oral medications. Also, some diabetics can monitor their blood sugar, make specific changes to their diet and exercise to keep from aggravating the disease. --- “If they can change it with diet they need to do it…get checked every three months and always check their blood sugar…and watch their weight,” Eller said. --- According to the ADA, the only cure for diabetes is to have a pancreas transplant – a procedure that is only done for insulin-dependent diabetics suffering from complications. For the majority of diabetics, the condition can only be controlled through medication, diet and exercise. --- “The first month was awful, I went from not having to worry about anything to worrying about everything,” he said. “Just keep your head up, it will get easier.” ---  Type 1 diabetes --- Usually diagnosed in children and young adults and was previously known as juvenile diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin. ---  Type 2 diabetes --- Type 2 is most common form of diabetes. Either the body does not produce enough insulin or the cells ignore the insulin. When eating, the body breaks down the sugars and starches into glucose, which is the basic fuel for the cells in the body. Insulin takes the sugar from the blood into the cells. When glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into cells, it causes cells to starve for energy and over time high blood glucose levels may hurt the eyes, kidneys, nerves or heart. ---  Nutrition --- People with diabetes have the same nutritional needs as anyone else. Along with exercise and medications, nutrition is important for good diabetes control, according to the American Diabetes Association. By eating well-balanced meals in the correct amounts, diabetics can thrive. ---  Symptoms --- • Frequent urination --- • Excessive thirst --- • Extreme hunger --- • Unusual weight loss --- • Increased fatigue --- • Irritability --- • Blurry vision ---  Treatment --- • Monitor your blood sugar regularly. Adjustments in diet, medication and exercise can be made accordingly. --- • Stick to the monitoring protocol prescribed by your doctor. Generally, blood is monitored before meals and at bedtime. --- • Utilize blood testing. In the past, urine testing was more common, but blood is more accurate. New and improved ways to test blood are being developed all the time. Check with your doctor, your pharmacist or the company that manufactures your monitoring equipment. --- • Take your medication as prescribed, whether it is insulin or an oral drug. --- • Develop a personal meal plan that you will stick with. Speak with a nutritionist or a diabetic educator and be candid about your food likes and dislikes. --- • Stay on your meal plan. Explore new foods, but keep track of how they affect you. --- • Eat carbohydrates that supply plenty of fiber, vitamins and minerals, such as fresh vegetables and fruit. Save sugary foods for special occasions. --- • Lose weight if you are overweight. Losing weight can make a big difference in your treatment plan. Many people are able to eliminate or reduce the amount of medication needed - or avoid needing it in the first place - once they take the weight off. ---  • Speak with your doctor if your program doesn't appear to be keeping your blood sugar under control.
